Immune system health is an often neglected area of supplementation. However, without an immune system that is firing on all cylinders, the body becomes more susceptible to illness and infection. Intense training in particular is known to suppress the immune system; for example, research shows that those that have the highest levels of training are more at risk of upper respiratory tract Infections.

Someone who is constantly ill or run down either simply can’t train, or is compromising their quality of training – however, both lead to less stimulus for muscle growth and improvement. Look after your immune system by using one or more of the powerful supplements in our immune system health category.
