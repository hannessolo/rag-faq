Antioxidant Supplements
=======================

health-wellbeing/antioxidants

The role of antioxidants is to protect against oxidative stress and free radical damage that occurs both naturally and also through exercise. **Bulk™** have chosen the most effective antioxidant supplements available, to give you the greatest protection against oxidative stress.

Throughout life, the body goes through a degree of oxidative stress which, in turn, causes cell damage and can contribute to disease, ageing, diabetes and more. If you’re engaged in an active exercise programme, the very nature of exercise can also increase oxidative damage. Free radicals (which are responsible for tissue damage) are produced in cells and tissues during exercise. The range of antioxidant supplements listed on this page has been chosen specifically to reduce oxidative stress caused by free radicals.

What’s more exciting is that many of the antioxidants in our range also have other benefits, beyond and above their roles as antioxidants. These benefits range from anti-aging to increasing energy levels!

Antioxidant Supplements FAQS
----------------------------

What are antioxidants?

When you consume certain nutrients and minerals, they’re at risk of oxidising in your body. This is a process which can produce free radicals and other chain reactions that may damage your body’s cells. Antioxidants are chemical compounds that prevent oxidation, and are therefore an essential part of any diet.

What are the benefits of taking antioxidant supplements?

Antioxidants help your body to remove free radicals from cells, so the benefits of antioxidants extend to every cell in the human body. For example, one of the most important vitamins in your daily diet, Vitamin C, is a powerful antioxidant, contributing to a number of anti-oxidising processes in your body.

Are antioxidant supplements healthy?

Antioxidant supplements are an ideal dietary supplement for anyone living a healthy, active lifestyle with a diverse diet, particularly if you’re concerned about your body’s cell health. If you experience any long-term health conditions or have any other doubts, you should consult with your doctor or a medical professional before taking any antioxidant supplements.

When should you take antioxidant tablets?

Most antioxidant supplements are designed to be taken once or twice a day. Because they contain concentrated measures of antioxidants, it’s generally advised to take antioxidant supplements after meals to ensure all of the nutrients are properly absorbed. Most people choose to take antioxidant supplements after breakfast or dinner each day.

Who should take antioxidant powders?

Antioxidant supplements are generally designed for anyone and everyone. You can even find antioxidant supplements for specific dietary needs, such as for women and children. If you experience any long-term health conditions, or have any concerns about your health and dietary intake, you should of course consult with a doctor or medical professional before taking any antioxidant supplement.

What are the different types of antioxidants?

There are many types of antioxidants. The most well known are Vitamin C and Vitamin E, which perform a whole range of antioxidant functions in the body. There are also a wide range of antioxidants including carotenoids such as Beta-Carotene, Lutein, Zeaxanthine and Lycopene.

What are the most powerful antioxidants?

Each antioxidant serves its own important purpose in the body, but some potent antioxidants are Vitamin C and Vitamin E that both contribute to a wide range of functions in your body’s cells, organs and bloodstream to remove free radicals and maintain healthy cell functions.

Are antioxidant products worth taking?

Antioxidants are an essential part of any healthy diet, and absolutely worth taking for that reason. Though you can find most antioxidants in regular foods, particularly Vitamin C, some antioxidants are difficult to get from food alone, so it’s a great idea to supplement your diet with antioxidants to ensure you’re getting a healthy intake.
