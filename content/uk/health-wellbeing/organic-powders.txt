health-wellbeing/organic-powders

Organic powders are produced on organic farms, using environmentally and animal-friendly farming methods.

These methods are legally defined and any powder sold as ‘organic’ must be strictly regulated by these standards. It’s these impressive production processes that help maintain high-quality, nutritious products.

This organic supplements range now includes products like [Cacao Powder](/uk/products/organic-cacao-powder/bpb-caca), [Baobab Powder](/uk/products/organic-baobab-powder/bpb-baob), Lucuma Powder and Moringa Powder, to name but a few– with new additions being added all the time.
