| The popularity of fish oils stems from the fact that they are excellent sources of EPA & DHA; two essential fatty acids that must be consumed in the diet, due to the body's inability to synthesise them. EPA & DHA are known to have a wide range of benefits - from promoting everyday health to providing joint support.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| What are fish oils?                                   | Fish oil is a term that loosely refers to any oil which   |
|                                                       | is sourced from the tissues of oily fish, such as salmon, |
|                                                       | cod, and even krill. Fish oils have been popular as a     |
|                                                       | health and nutritional supplement for decades, thanks to  |
|                                                       | their high Essential Fatty Acid (EFA) and Omega 3         |

| What are the benefits of fish oil supplements?        | The primary benefit of fish oil supplements is that they  |
|                                                       | contain Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs), which your body     |
|                                                       | cannot produce on its own, meaning you have to get them   |
|                                                       | from food. Essential Fatty Acids such as Omega 3 fatty    |
|                                                       | acids contribute to a wide range of vital bodily          |
|                                                       | functions, from maintenance of normal blood cholesterol   |
|                                                       | levels to normal functioning of the heart. The benefit of |
|                                                       | taking them is that you know you're getting essential     |

| Are they healthy?                                     | Fish oils are healthy insofar as they contribute to       |
|                                                       | normal function of your body and mind. As the name        |
|                                                       | suggests, however, they’re oil, a type of fat, so you     |
|                                                       | should avoid consuming them in excess amounts. They’re    |
|                                                       | typically found in foods in small amounts, and            |
|                                                       | supplements contain measured amounts, so this is unlikely |
|                                                       | to be an issue.                                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| What is the best time to take it?                     | As a vital part of your diet, you should try to consume   |
|                                                       | some form of Essential Fatty Acids every single day, and  |
|                                                       | fish oils are a great choice for this. Most Fish Oil      |

|                                                       | to ensure they’re getting a healthy intake regardless of  |
