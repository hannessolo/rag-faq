|                                                       | multivitamins have a distinct, metallic flavour – that’s  |
|                                                       | why they’re usually served in a pill form that’s intended |
|                                                       | to be swallowed with water. There are also many flavoured |
|                                                       | and chewable multivitamins designed to provide a more     |
|                                                       | pleasant taste if you struggle with swallowing pills.     |

| Who should take multivitamins?                        | Multivitamins are generally designed for anyone and       |
|                                                       | everyone, which is why you can find multivitamin          |
|                                                       | supplements for men and women, as well as children’s      |
|                                                       | multivitamins with smaller measurements. If you           |
|                                                       | experience any long-term health conditions, or have any   |
|                                                       | concerns about your health and dietary intake, you should |
|                                                       | of course consult with a doctor or medical professional   |
|                                                       | before taking any multivitamin supplement.                |
+-------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Is a balanced diet better than a multivitamin?        | Supplements are never intended to replace food as they    |
|                                                       | simply cannot replicate the nutrients found in real food. |
|                                                       | So, of course, consuming a varied, well-balanced diet     |
|                                                       | would be the most optimal way to obtain adequate          |
|                                                       | nutrients. A multivitamin would only help fill in         |
|                                                       | potential nutritional gaps, helping to further optimise   |
|                                                       | your nutrition and support your body's functions, such as |
|                                                       | the immune system and nervous system.                     |
