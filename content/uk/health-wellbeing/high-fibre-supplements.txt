| Fibre is a fundamental part of a balanced diet – the Department of Health recommends a daily intake of 30g per day. |
| One key role of fibre is aiding the digestive system in processing food. As an active individual, total calorie     |
| intake is likely to be higher than average, so it could be beneficial to consumer a slightly higher amount of fibre |
| than the average person. This makes high fibre supplements an ideal proposition for many, especially those who      |
| struggle to get enough fibre through their regular eating habits.                                                   |
|                                                                                                                     |

| What are high fibre supplements?                  | High fibre supplements are a range of nutritional         |
|                                                   | powders, capsules and other formulas intended to increase |
|                                                   | your daily intake of dietary fibre, which promotes        |
|                                                   | healthy, regular digestion. Fibre is crucial to any       |
|                                                   | healthy diet, and it can sometimes be difficult to get    |
|                                                   | your full daily intake from food alone. These supplements |
|                                                   | are great to give you a daily boost.                      |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| What is the benefit of taking fibre supplements?  | Dietary fibre aids digestion by helping food to pass      |
|                                                   | through the digestive tract. It comes in two forms:       |
|                                                   | insoluble fibre, also known as roughage, which helps to   |
|                                                   | push food through the GI tract, and soluble fibre, which  |
|                                                   | bonds digested foods together so they pass more           |
|                                                   | comfortably.                                              |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Are fibre supplements healthy?                    | Fibre supplements are one of the most commonly taken      |
|                                                   | supplements in the world today, enjoyed by millions of    |
|                                                   | people for their health and digestive benefits. Think of  |
|                                                   | them the same way as vitamin and mineral supplements.     |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| When to take fibre supplements?                   | Because they’re designed to aid digestion, the best time  |
|                                                   | to take fibre supplements is shortly after meals. You can |
|                                                   | take them any time of the day, however, and most people   |
|                                                   | choose to take them either first thing in the morning, or |
|                                                   | just before bedtime.                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| How much fibre supplements can you take in a day? | Generally, you should only take as much fibre supplement  |
|                                                   | as you need to meet your recommended daily intake. You    |
|                                                   | should continue to seek fibre in your regular food and    |
|                                                   | nutrition, and while taking excess fibre won’t            |
|                                                   | necessarily harm you, it won’t provide any benefits       |
|                                                   | either. As a general rule, take one recommended serving   |
|                                                   | after each meal, or as instructed.                        |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Why is fibre important for the body?              | Fibre is important for the body in both soluble and       |
|                                                   | insoluble forms because it promotes healthy gut and       |
|                                                   | intestinal functions, and helps food to pass regularly    |
|                                                   | through the body. Some foods, especially ones high in fat |
|                                                   | and oil, can cause digestive issues without fibre to aid  |
|                                                   | digestion, and because human beings eat more processed    |
|                                                   | and soft foods than we did in the past, we often struggle |
|                                                   | to eat as much fibre as our bodies need to function.      |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| What do fibre supplements taste like?             | Generally, fibre supplements are intended to be taken as  |
|                                                   | tablets, mixed with smoothies, or dissolved in water. As  |
|                                                   | a result, they tend not to have any flavour at all. Fibre |
|                                                   | can also be found in a range of natural foods, especially |
|                                                   | vegetarian and plant-based ingredients. The fibre-rich    |
|                                                   | foods we sell include grains, oats, seeds and nuts.       |
+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| What is the shelf life of fibre supplements?      | Fibre supplements are generally durable, with a long      |
|                                                   | shelf life. As a general rule, supplements, tablets and   |
|                                                   | powders are good for 12 months after their manufacturing  |
|                                                   | date, but you should check individual labels for precise  |
|                                                   | information. Fibre-rich foods such as oats, grains and    |
|                                                   | seeds are similarly stable, but you should check each     |
|                                                   | individual product for specific Best Before dates.        |
