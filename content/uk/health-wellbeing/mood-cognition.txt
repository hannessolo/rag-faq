| When should you take serotonin supplements?             | Serotonin is the key hormone in your body that supports   |

|                                                         | pretty important. Your body produces serotonin naturally  |
|                                                         | in the body, but at a limited rate, meaning sometimes     |

|                                                         | intense activity like long distance runs, or a long night |

| Is it OK to take mood supplements every day?            | Like the rest of your bodily functions, moods are a 24/7  |
|                                                         | thing, so it’s generally a good idea to take mood         |
|                                                         | supplements daily. In fact, most are intended to be taken |
|                                                         | as daily supplements, and people commonly take them daily |
|                                                         | to support normal mood stabilisation day in, day out.     |
