| What are the benefits of using a protein shaker? | The secret to protein shakers is the metal wire mixing    |
|                                                  | ball inside, which shakes around, breaking up your        |
|                                                  | protein powders and ensuring they are fully dissolved,    |
|                                                  | creating smooth, delicious shakes every time. It's the    |
|                                                  | easiest way to get quick, good results every time you     |
|                                                  | make a shake, and they're easy to rinse and dry after     |
|                                                  | every use.                                                |

| How to use a protein shaker cup?                 | Using a protein shaker is easy. Simply add water, or your |
|                                                  | preferred fluid such as milk or a dairy-free alternative, |
|                                                  | add your preferred measure of powder, close the shaker,   |
|                                                  | making sure everything is sealed tight, and then shake    |
|                                                  | for 15-30 seconds, until the powder has fully mixed.      |
|                                                  | Serve in a cup, or simply drink straight from the shaker. |
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| What materials are protein shakers made out of?  | Protein shakers come in a wide variety of materials and   |
|                                                  | colours, but they're most commonly made of plastic with a |
|                                                  | stainless steel wire mixing ball. The most popular are    |
|                                                  | plastic protein shakers, which are transparent, thus      |
|                                                  | allowing you to check your shakes are fully mixed before  |
|                                                  | you serve.                                                |
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| How does a protein shaker bottle work?           | Protein shaker bottles mainly work thanks to the wire     |
|                                                  | mixing ball, which helps to break up any clumps of powder |
|                                                  | in your drink in the same way a whisk or blender would.   |
|                                                  | If you consume protein shakes regularly, it's just easier |
|                                                  | to have a tool that you can grab, use, wash, and re-use   |
|                                                  | throughout the day, a perfect addition to any gym bag.    |
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| When should you drink a protein shake?           | As the cornerstone of any weight or resistance training   |
|                                                  | regime, protein shakes are usually consumed either        |
|                                                  | pre-workout or post-workout. You can even mix pre-workout |
|                                                  | formulas in protein shakers – but if you’re worried about |
|                                                  | mixing flavours, you might want to use a separate shaker  |
|                                                  | for different formulas.                                   |
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| How do you choose a protein shaker bottle?       | All protein shaker cups are very similar, but they vary   |
|                                                  | depending on specific needs. If you tend to drink small   |
|                                                  | portions throughout the day, consider a mini shaker. If   |
|                                                  | you drink mass gainers or bulking formulas, an            |
|                                                  | extra-large shaker will give you room for all that        |
|                                                  | powder.                                                   |
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Why is there a wire ball in a protein shaker?    | The wire mixing ball is the most important part of your   |
|                                                  | shaker – which you’ll learn if you ever mix and drink a   |
|                                                  | shake without it. It rattles around the cup as you shake, |
|                                                  | breaking up clumps of powder and ensuring the entire      |
|                                                  | formula is evenly mixed, so you don’t get a mouthful of   |
|                                                  | dry, lumpy protein shake (and trust us, you don’t want    |
|                                                  | that).                                                    |
+--------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
