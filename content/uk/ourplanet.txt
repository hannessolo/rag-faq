OUR PLANET
==========

The pursuit of fitness and nutrition is a perpetual journey of growth and adaptation. This same philosophy extends to the creation of our products,  
ensuring their evolution continues to align with our commitment to sustainability.

What Sustainability Means to Bulk™
----------------------------------

We believe that small changes add up to make a big difference. We're committed to reducing our footprint by embracing practices that prioritise the planet's health. Here are just some of the steps we've taken to make a positive impact:

*   All our pouches, pots and scoops are on track to be recyclable in 2024
*   Our delivery boxes are 100% recyclable and biodegradable (Forest Stewardship Council approved), the ink for branding is water based and uses water recycled up to 5 times
*   Our black tape for sealing completed cartons is fully paper-based and biodegradable
*   Smart system installed in Office and Warehouse - turning off heating, power when not needed
*   All cardboard / paper used at manufacturing sites is recycled
*   Our UK manufacturing site is partly powered by solar energy.

Packaging Changes
-----------------

We’re excited to have made the switch to recyclable pouches and pots, making it even  
simpler for you, our valued consumers, to recycle your Bulk™ products with ease.

We've also given our packaging a makeover. Our new designs are more user-friendly, making it easier for you to identify key nutrients in each product. Plus, we've added a splash of colour to help differentiate between our diverse range of products.

During this transition, you may notice a mix of new and old packaging in your orders. Don't worry though – the product inside remains the same high-quality sports nutrition you've come to expect from Bulk™ since day one.
