Lean Muscle

Ok, first things first: ‘lean muscle’ doesn’t really make much sense as there is no such thing as ‘fat muscle!’ However, lean muscle has become an industry recognised term that is now synonymous with a cover model look. To achieve a cover model body, the key consideration is to increase muscle whilst keeping body fat to an absolute minimum.

The key nutritional considerations for achieving a lean and muscular look are outlined below. For each consideration we have suggested 1-2 products that should more than help you on your way…

**Protein**: An essential nutrient for muscle growth and repair. Research suggests that around 2g protein per kilogram of bodyweight is required each day, so, if you’re 90kg: 90 x 2 = 180g protein daily. A high quality [Whey Protein Isolate](https://staging.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-isolate-90/bpb-wpi9-0000)  will provide you with plenty!

**Carbohydrates**: The majority of carbohydrate intake should come from a complex, slow release carbohydrate to provide a sustained release of energy. [Ultra Fine Scottish Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ultra-fine-scottish-oats/bpb-oats-0000) are the perfect example of a complex carbohydrate due to their low GI (Glycemic Index) nature and ability to prevent muscle from being used as fuel. Alternatively, consider [Complete Lean Mass™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-lean-mass-gainer/bble-clma), which is a combination of high quality protein and carbohydrates.

**Fats**: An emphasis should be placed on ensuring enough good fats are included within your diet, particularly [Omega 3](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/super-strength-omega-3-softgels/bpb-o3ss-0000), which will help to prevent muscle loss, promote fat loss and maintain healthy joints.

**Fat Burners**: Used in conjunction with a balanced diet and training plan, fat loss supplements such as [Complete Thermogenic™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-thermogenic/bble-cthe)  help to speed up the fat loss process, giving the lean cover model look that most people aspire to.

**Anything else?**  [Beta Alanine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/beta-alanine/bpb-bala-0000) and [Creatine Monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate/bpb-cmon-0000) allow the user to train harder for longer. For anyone looking to attain a lean and muscular physique this is ideal as the rate of fat burning is increased and muscle gains are achieved faster too.
