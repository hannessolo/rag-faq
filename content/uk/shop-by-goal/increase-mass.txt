| If your goal is to increase muscle mass, then food really is your best friend! To put on size, additional calories are vital. It’s not always easy to get these additional calories from food due to time constraints, which is where supplementation often comes in.                                                                                                                                        |
| Supplements are an easy and convenient way of ensuring your body gets the calories and nutrients it needs to grow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| The key considerations in terms of nutrition for increasing mass are outlined below. For each consideration we have suggested 1-2 products that should more than help you on your way…                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Protein**: To build muscle, protein is needed. Research suggests around 2g protein per kilogram of bodyweight, but we'd suggest even more if you’re looking to put on some serious size. [Whey Protein](https://staging.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000) and Liquid Egg Whites are the most cost-effective method of supplying your body with high quality protein for muscle growth. |

| **Carbohydrates**: The goal of getting heavier shouldn’t be seen as an excuse to eat absolutely anything. Aim for quality calories, such as [Ultra Fine Scottish Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ultra-fine-scottish-oats/bpb-oats-0000), which are a slow release **,**  low GI (Glycemic Index) carbohydrate.                                                                                       |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Fats**: As with carbohydrates, the goal of getting heavier shouldn’t mean that no regard is given to the quality of calories. While a fatty fast food meal is ok once in a while, try to ensure that the diet has a focus on healthy, essential fats such as omega 3. [Fish Oils](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/omega-3-fish-oil-softgels/bpb-omg3-0000) are one of the best sources of omega 3.        |

| **Weight Gainers**: Weight gain shakes such as [Complete Mass™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-mass-gainer/bble-cmas) provide a quality, convenient, source of additional calories and can be consumed in addition to meals and other supplements.                                                                                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Anything else?** Supplements such as [HMB](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hmb-powder-2/bpb-hmb-0000) and [Creatine Monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate/bpb-cmon-0000) promote mass gain and help to improve recovery and performance.                                                                                                                                     |
