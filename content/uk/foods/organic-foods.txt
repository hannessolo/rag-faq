Organic food is food which is produced using environmentally and animal friendly farming methods on organic farms. These methods are legally defined and any food sold as ‘organic’ must be strictly regulated by these standards.

It’s these impressive production processes that help maintain high quality, nutritious products – retaining the Organic integrity – something that we are increasingly passionate about here at **Bulk™**.

Our Organic Foods range now includes products like Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, Organic Raw Cacao Nibs and Organic Lucuma Powder – with new additions being added all the time.

Organic Foods FAQS
------------------

What does 'organic' mean?

In the context of food, organic refers to any food or drink that has been produced without the use of artificial chemicals, fertilisers, pesticides or other non-natural products. Organic fruits and vegetables are grown without any of these things, and organic prepared foods only contain ingredients that have been produced organically.

What are the benefits of organic food products?

There are a number of benefits to organic foods. Most importantly, anything in your food will eventually end up inside of you, so by consuming organic foods, you avoid consuming any of the chemicals used to grow non-organic foods. Organic foods are also often of a higher quality with better nutrition and fewer preservatives or other additives.

Are organic supplements healthy?

Organic supplements are as healthy as any other nutritional supplement, whether a food product or an ingredient, with the added benefit that they don’t contain any artificial chemicals, flavours, fertilisers or other additives. They’re often better for the environment also, as the farming process involves only natural fertilisers and farming methods.

When should you take organic products?

Your intake of organic foods depends on your commitment to organic eating. Nowadays, you can find organic options of all types of foods, from meat, dairy and vegetables to cooking ingredients and nutritional supplements. But if you’re particularly concerned about artificial food additives, pesticides and fertilisers, the simple answer is that you should eat organic products as often as possible.

Is it OK to take organic supplements every day?

Organic foods and supplements are intended to be a more natural alternative to foods and supplements that we eat and drink every day anyway, so there’s no reason you can’t eat organic supplements everyday. Just remember that the same rules about calorie intake and nutritional balance applies – just because your carbs are organic, doesn’t mean you can eat as much as you like without putting on weight.

How are organic supplements made?

The organic method is more about what you don’t use than what you do. In other words, organic farming and production involves no artificial chemicals such as fertilisers, pesticides or other additives. This generally means that they’re grown using natural alternatives, such as natural pesticides like garlic spray. Otherwise, they’re made the same way as any other food you’d find in the supermarket.

Are organic supplements better than regular supplements?

It’s hard to say whether organic supplements are “better” than regular supplements because it depends on personal preference. It’s probably better to say they’re just different. All supplements are intended to be completely safe for human consumption, and people take and enjoy them every day as part of a healthy diet. Organic options are purely for people who would prefer to avoid artificial production methods and ingredients. If that’s important to you then, in that sense, organic supplements are better.

What are the healthiest organic supplements?

Organic foods are like regular foods – they come in all shapes and sizes with all sorts of nutritional profiles, so which is healthiest depends upon what kind of nutrition you’re looking for. Our favourite healthy organic supplements are our organic seed, nut and vegetable powders, which are great for adding extra nutrition to recipes and shakes.
