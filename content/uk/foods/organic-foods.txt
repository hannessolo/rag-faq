|                                                          | importantly, anything in your food will eventually end up |
|                                                          | inside of you, so by consuming organic foods, you avoid   |

| When should you take organic products?                   | Your intake of organic foods depends on your commitment   |
|                                                          | to organic eating. Nowadays, you can find organic options |
|                                                          | of all types of foods, from meat, dairy and vegetables to |

|                                                          | you’re particularly concerned about artificial food       |

|                                                          | is that you should eat organic products as often as       |

| Is it OK to take organic supplements every day?          | Organic foods and supplements are intended to be a more   |
|                                                          | natural alternative to foods and supplements that we eat  |
|                                                          | and drink every day anyway, so there’s no reason you      |
|                                                          | can’t eat organic supplements everyday. Just remember     |
|                                                          | that the same rules about calorie intake and nutritional  |
|                                                          | balance applies – just because your carbs are organic,    |
|                                                          | doesn’t mean you can eat as much as you like without      |

+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| How are organic supplements made?                        | The organic method is more about what you don’t use than  |
|                                                          | what you do. In other words, organic farming and          |
|                                                          | production involves no artificial chemicals such as       |
|                                                          | fertilisers, pesticides or other additives. This          |
|                                                          | generally means that they’re grown using natural          |
|                                                          | alternatives, such as natural pesticides like garlic      |
|                                                          | spray. Otherwise, they’re made the same way as any other  |
|                                                          | food you’d find in the supermarket.                       |

| Are organic supplements better than regular supplements? | It’s hard to say whether organic supplements are “better” |
|                                                          | than regular supplements because it depends on personal   |
|                                                          | preference. It’s probably better to say they’re just      |
|                                                          | different. All supplements are intended to be completely  |
|                                                          | safe for human consumption, and people take and enjoy     |
|                                                          | them every day as part of a healthy diet. Organic options |
|                                                          | are purely for people who would prefer to avoid           |
|                                                          | artificial production methods and ingredients. If that’s  |
|                                                          | important to you then, in that sense, organic supplements |
|                                                          | are better.                                               |

|                                                          | so which is healthiest depends upon what kind of          |
