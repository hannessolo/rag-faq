High Protein Breakfast foods FAQS What is a high protein breakfast? Most people think of breakfast and immediately think of carbs. High protein breakfasts are an alternative approach for people on a high protein diet. Nowadays there’s a whole range of high-protein versions of classic breakfast meals to kickstart your day. Whether you’re a muffin lover or a pancake addict, there’s something for you. What are the benefits of a high protein breakfast? Some people struggle to spread their protein intake across the day, which is vital for ensuring steady, continuous muscle growth throughout the day. A high protein breakfast is an ideal way to add extra protein to your diet without drowning in shakes, and offers a different way to pack in the protein. Is a high protein breakfast healthy? Just like regular breakfasts, a high protein breakfast is a healthy way to start the day as part of an active lifestyle with a healthy diet. Our high protein breakfast foods are designed to provide ample nutrition on top of your needed protein, so you can enjoy your Protein Pancakes and know you’re getting a healthy nutritional intake, as well as a delicious breakfast. Can you eat breakfast to bulk up every day? Breakfast is one of the most neglected meals of the day, which means it’s a great place to start if you’re bulking up. Our protein-enriched Pancake Mix and Porridge Mix are ideal if you’re on a bulking cycle and want to pack every meal with vital protein and calories. Just monitor your calorie intake the same as you would any other meal, and consult with your dietician to ensure your recipes work for your plan. What are some quick high protein foods you can have for breakfast? If you want to make sure you’re getting your daily nutrition in your breakfast but don’t have much time in the mornings, you can try our Breakfast Smoothie, or one of our Protein Porridge Pots. They’re both designed to be ready as quickly as possible with minimal preparation, and they’re loaded with vital nutrition so you can still enjoy a full breakfast.

Our premium oats were selected with bulking programmes in mind, and they mix great with whatever other ingredients you want to add for extra flavour or nutrition. What is the best breakfast to eat? Regardless of your dietary programme, breakfast is a crucial meal to kickstart your day the right way. If you usually exercise in the morning, we recommend eating a carb-rich breakfast to give you the energy you need for your workout. If you’re cutting, try an egg white omelette or even a smoothie (avoid sugary fruits and berries!).
