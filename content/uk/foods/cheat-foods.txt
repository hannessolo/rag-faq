| What is a cheat meal?                               | If you’re on a serious training regime, whether cardio or |
|                                                     | strength-based, meat-eater or vegetarian, you’re probably |
|                                                     | having to watch your daily intake of calories, especially |
|                                                     | protein, fat and carbs. A cheat meal is basically any     |
|                                                     | meal where you let yourself relax and just eat what you   |
|                                                     | like without worrying too much about the calorie          |
|                                                     | breakdown.                                                |

| What is a cheat day?                                | A cheat day is basically the same as a cheat meal, but    |
|                                                     | for a whole day. If you work out regularly throughout the |
|                                                     | week and pay strict attention to the food you’re eating,  |
|                                                     | you deserve to relax every one in a while. A lot of       |
|                                                     | people allow themselves one cheat day a week to just      |
|                                                     | enjoy themselves. Think of it as the “weekend” to your    |
|                                                     | workouts.                                                 |

| How often can you have a cheat meal?                | There’s no single hard-and-fast rule about how, when, or  |
|                                                     | why you can have a cheat day. Most people choose to base  |
|                                                     | their cheat days on their own performance and how they’re |
|                                                     | progressing on their own fitness journey. Use cheat days  |
|                                                     | to reward yourself for your progress, but if you find     |
|                                                     | yourself struggling to progress because your cheat days   |
|                                                     | keep setting you back, consider having them less          |
|                                                     | frequently.                                               |

| Does snacking ruin your gains?                      | Snacking doesn’t necessarily ruin your gains (after all,  |
|                                                     | it depends on what you’re snacking on) but snacks are     |
|                                                     | generally where we pay less attention to the nutrients    |
|                                                     | we’re consuming, which is made worse by the fact that     |
|                                                     | snacks are often the least healthy foods we eat. So while |
|                                                     | snacking in itself isn’t bad, you should still be careful |
|                                                     | about what foods you choose to snack on.                  |
