| What are dried fruits?                          | Dried fruits are basically any kind of fruit or berry     |
|                                                 | which has been treated to remove any water or moisture    |
|                                                 | content, leaving just the concentrated solid matter and   |
|                                                 | nutrients intact. Dried fruits are some of the most       |
|                                                 | popular snacking foods around today, and can be found in  |
|                                                 | a range of common foods like cereals.                     |

| What are the benefits of dried fruits?          | Dried fruits are typically prepared in such a way that    |
|                                                 | they retain all of the fruit’s original nutritional       |
|                                                 | content, but remove all of the moisture and water         |
|                                                 | content. As a result, they have a longer shelf life than  |
|                                                 | regular fruit, which goes off quickly, creating a         |
|                                                 | convenient, nutritional snack.                            |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Are dried fruit mixes healthy?                  | Dried fruits are the same as regular fruit, just with the |
|                                                 | moisture and water content removed, so they’re as healthy |
|                                                 | as regular fruit. This also means they retain any other   |
|                                                 | nutritional content, such as sugars or fats, so you       |
|                                                 | should still consume them in moderation if you’re         |
|                                                 | concerned about consuming too many carbs or fats.         |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| When should you take dried fruits?              | Dried fruits are intended for a wide range of culinary    |
|                                                 | uses, including mixed into baking or breakfast recipes,   |
|                                                 | or as a casual snack between meals. So, basically, you    |
|                                                 | can consume dried fruits whenever, wherever and however   |
|                                                 | you like, so long as it fits with your dietary            |
|                                                 | requirements.                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| How are dried fruit products produced?          | Dried fruits are typically prepared by picking regular    |
|                                                 | fruit, and then treating them to a drying process as      |
|                                                 | quickly as possible, to retain the fruit’s essential      |
|                                                 | organic nutrients. The most common drying process used is |
|                                                 | freeze drying. Without getting too technical, this        |
|                                                 | basically involves freezing the fruit, and then removing  |
|                                                 | it from the fruit using a secondary process. The benefit  |
|                                                 | of this is that it retains the fruit’s original           |
|                                                 | nutritional content, unlike heat drying processes.        |

| What are the most common types of dried fruits? | Nowadays you can find dried varieties of all kinds of     |
|                                                 | fruit. The dried fruits that bulk® sells are those best   |
|                                                 | suited to fitness and training dietary requirements, such |
|                                                 | as dried berries which can add a little flavour to        |
|                                                 | breakfast porridge or cereal, as well as dried fruit and  |
|                                                 | nut mixes to be snacked on between meals.                 |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| How do dried fruit products taste?              | Because they’re just regular fruit with the water content |
|                                                 | removed, most dried fruits taste similar to their         |
|                                                 | original fruit, but with a more concentrated taste.       |
|                                                 | Because they’re dried, they tend to have a higher         |
|                                                 | concentration of sugar than their original form, so they  |
|                                                 | might taste a bit sweeter, also.                          |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| What is the shelf life of dried fruits?         | One of the biggest benefits of dried fruit is that they   |
|                                                 | have a much longer shelf life than their regular          |
|                                                 | counterparts. Fresh fruit usually has a shelf life of a   |
|                                                 | few days; dried fruit, on the other hand, can last up to  |
|                                                 | 12 months past its production date. Check the individual  |
|                                                 | labels of your dried fruit for more specific Best Before  |
|                                                 | information.                                              |
