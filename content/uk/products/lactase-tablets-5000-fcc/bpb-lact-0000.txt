### Lactase Tablets

High dose lactase tablet supplements to aid digestion of lactose, providing more active ingredients per tablet than the majority of competing products.

Lactose is a simple sugar most commonly found in milk and dairy products. Many people struggle to digest lactose, which can create challenges if you want to supplement with dairy-sourced nutrition like whey protein. Our Lactase Tablets provide a high dose of lactase, the digestive enzyme that helps the body to break down lactose.

FCC stands for Food Chemical Codex, a unit of measurement used to measure enzyme activity. Our Lactase Tablets contain 5000 FCC units of lactase per supplement, a potent dose that’s higher than many competing products.

\\

### Purpose

Our Lactase Tablets are primarily for people who struggle to digest lactose, such as individuals with lactose intolerance. However, lactose tolerance varies from person to person, so you should consult with your doctor or a medical professional for advice to find out if lactase is an appropriate supplement for your requirements.
