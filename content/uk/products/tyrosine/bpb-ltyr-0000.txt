### Tyrosine

100% pure l-tyrosine powder, providing a potent source of the adrenaline pre-cursor in an ideal form for mixing into your favourite pre-workout or DIY formula.

Tyrosine is an amino acid that is a chemical precursor to the body’s production of adrenaline, making it a popular ingredient in pre-workout formulas. Our tyrosine powder allows you to mix tyrosine into your favourite pre-workout blend, or even integrate it into your own DIY formula.

Tyrosine can be produced in the body from phenylalanine, and can be found in certain foods such as bananas and avocados. However, dietary intake of tyrosine is typically quite low, so many athletes and trainers choose to supplement their diet with tyrosine to ensure they’re getting sustained, regular intake.

\\

### Purpose

Our tyrosine powder is a great ingredient for experienced trainers who like to create their own personal formulas. As a chemical precursor to adrenaline, we recommend using it as part of a pre-workout blend for optimal effect.
