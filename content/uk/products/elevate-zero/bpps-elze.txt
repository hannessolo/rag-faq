### Elevate Zero Pre-Workout

The ultimate low-sugar pre-workout supplement for professional athletes and elite trainers. Each 22g serving provides a combined 19g of 10 active ingredients, with only 0.2g of sugar and less than 2g of carbs. Lab tested for banned substances and athlete approved. If you don’t love it, we’ll give you your money back\*.

Elevate™ Zero is the low-sugar iteration of our popular Elevate™ pre-workout formula. The product of months of research and refinement, it provides all the stimulation you need to prepare for an intense workout session, with minimal sugar intake. And best of all, it’s available in a range of delicious flavours.

As with all of our **bulk** PRO® products, Elevate™ Zero is developed for professional athletes and elite trainers, with no expense spared. That means the highest quality ingredients, including exclusive and proprietary formulas, adding up to create the ultimate pre-workout boost.

*   **Citrulline Malate** Citrulline malate is an expensive ingredient, so most formulas settle for low dosages. Instead, we added an impressive 5g in each and every serving.
*   **Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AAKG)** AAKG can be found in almost every pre-workout, but few give you 4g in a single serving.
*   **Beta Alanine** We added 3.5g of beta alanine in each serving of Elevate™ Zero.
*   **Trimethylglycine (TMG)** Closely related to creatine, TMG is rarely found in pre-workout formulas. And it’s even rarer to find a pre-workout that contains the full 3g dosage.
*   **Taurine** Taurine is a popular ingredient in many commercial energy drinks. We added 2.5g to every serving.
*   **Glucuronolactone** An ingredient in energy drinks that’s rising in popularity. We added 500mg of glucuronolactone to each serving of Elevate™ Zero.
*   **L-Tyrosine** Tyrosine is an amino acid that’s a precursor to adrenaline, so we added 400mg to each serving.
*   **Caffeine** Caffeine is probably the world’s most popular stimulant, shown to increase alertness, improve concentration and reduce perceived exertion (how quickly you feel tired when training). We added 200mg to help increase endurance capacity and performance during your workout.
*   **Vitamin B6** Part of the B vitamin family, we added 5mg of vitamin B6 to Elevate™ to contribute to reduced tiredness and fatigue.
*   **BioPerine®** BioPerine® is a natural thermonutrient that’s extracted from the Piper nigrum L plant (black pepper). We added 5mg to each serving to increase the absorption rate of all other ingredients.
