### Cordyceps Capsules 500mg

The mighty mushroom is becoming an increasingly popular nootropic supplement. The cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis) isn’t your average mushroom. Traditionally, it grows in a rather unusual way. But we’ve found a vegetarian and vegan friendly formula that doesn’t involve caterpillars and zombies.

Long and spindly in appearance, the cordyceps is native to high-altitude areas in Asia and has been enjoyed as a food for centuries. It’s also been used in traditional Ayurvedic medicine and more recently as a supplement in Western culture.

Time for some science. When taking mushrooms as supplements, here’s what to look out for. First are the active components called polysaccharides, which are found in the cell walls of fungi. Beta-glucans, the most well-known fungal polysaccharide, are a soluble fibre broken down in the intestine. Each capsule contains a potent 150mg polysaccharides (standardised 30% dosage). Second is the strength of the extract. These are dosed at a 8:1, so 500mg cordyceps extract per capsule is the equivalent to 4g fresh mushroom.

So how do we extract the goodness? Traditionally, cordyceps is a parasitic fungus that grows on caterpillars. We decided against that method. It’s become possible to cultivate the mushroom without the need for caterpillars or other bugs. This makes our Cordyceps Capsules vegetarian and vegan friendly (and kinder to caterpillars).
