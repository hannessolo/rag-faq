### Vegan Protein Powder

Ready for an upgrade? We’ve pimped up our original multi-protein vegan blend. Smoother, tastier and a better performer. Because there’s always room for improvement.

So what’s the difference? It’s all about the ingredients. We’ve switched brown rice protein for soya protein isolate, which is higher in protein and gives a creamier texture. The ratios of our exclusive multi-protein blend (soya protein, pea protein, pumpkin seed, quinoa flour and flaxseed powder) have been refined for a smoother shake. Making a few tweaks to the flavours, the taste is now richer. With added DigeZyme®, to help break down the protein, this is a winning plant-based formula.

\*27g of protein per serving links to Unflavoured.

\\

### Purpose

Our Vegan Protein Powder is ideal if you’re following a plant-based diet and looking to increase your protein intake as part of a healthy, balanced lifestyle. This is a great (and convincing) alternative to whey protein shakes.

### FAQs

### What are the benefits of using Vegan Protein Powder?

Classic protein powder, now available in a plant-based formula. Our Vegan Protein Powder uses our V+ plant-based blend, which uses a combination of 5 vegan protein sources to provide a full protein profile, and it’s available in 9 delicious flavours, so you can get a full intake of powerful protein no matter what your preference. Whether you’re a committed vegan, or just looking to cut down your meat and dairy intake, this powder is ideal.

### Who should take Vegan Protein Powder?

Our vegan protein powder is the ideal option for those on vegan or plant-based diets - but due to its high protein content, it's not just vegans who can benefit. This is an excellent protein variety, easily implemented into any diet.

### What does it taste like?

Our Vegan Protein powder is available in a host of flavours, designed to suit your tastebuds. You can mix our powder with water, or even a plant-based milk, to enjoy the fullness of the flavour throughout the day. Looking for more protein flavours, plant-based and otherwise? Check out our range of [chocolate protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/chocolate-protein-powders.html "chocolate protein powders"), [vanilla protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/vanilla-protein-powders.html "vanilla protein powders"), [banana protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/banana-protein-powders.html "banana protein powders"), [strawberry protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/strawberry-protein-powders.html " strawberry protein powders"), [peanut protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/peanut-protein-powders.html " peanut protein powders"), [cookie protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/cookie-protein-powders.html "cookie protein powders"), and [coconut protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/coconut-protein-powders.html "coconut protein powders").

### Are there any dietary restrictions?

Vegan Protein Powder is an excellent option for you, regardless of which diet you follow. So even if you're a meat-eater looking for a versatile and fresh protein blend - this is for you.

### Is vegan protein better than whey?

When it comes to our high-quality protein powders, it really is splitting hairs. Both have different nutritional profiles, and whilst our Vegan Protein Powder has the slight edge on protein content (23g vs 22g per serving), our Whey option has 5g of BCAAs per serving. Of course - there's no worries, as we have vegan-friendly Amino Acid supplements available for you too.
