### Ultra Fine Oats

A premium source of slow release carbohydrates. Ideal for adding to shakes for an extra hit of energy without the unnecessary sugar.

Oats are probably best known as a breakfast food, but they’re great for sports nutrition. High in complex carbohydrates and low in sugar, they’re an ideal ingredient for protein shakes and weight gain programmes.

These Ultra Fine Oats have been ground down to an ultra fine powder, making them easy to add to your favourite protein shakes, smoothies, and even baking recipes.

\\

### Purpose

Our Ultra Fine Oats are adaptable, versatile and easy to mix, so they’re perfect for integrating into your regular nutritional regime. They’re especially good for athletes on a weight gain programme who need extra calories to pile on the muscle.
