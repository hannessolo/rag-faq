This planet-friendly protein supplement is a high-achiever. A banana and spinach smoothie, a home-baked blondie, crumbly cookies or vegan scrambled eggs. Get cooking. Get creative. There’ll be nothing stopping you.

It’s time to choose your flavour. Simply Vanilla, creamy Coconut, brave Banana or daring Chocolate Mint. Keep it simple with Unflavoured and make it your own. After rigorous testing, we chose yellow peas for this formula, which offer the best flavour, solubility and quality without sacrificing the protein content.

### FAQs

### What are the benefits of pea protein isolate?

Pea protein isolate is a plant-based protein powder that makes a great alternative to animal-based protein powders. It is vegan-friendly and contains all nine essential amino acids, including the BCAAs, making it a complete protein source. Pea protein offers a convenient and effective way of meeting your daily protein requirements, providing fundamental support for post-workout recovery and muscle repair.

### How do I use it?

Pea protein isolate can be used in various ways, including as a post-workout shake, mixed with smoothies, added to porridge or yoghurt, or used as an ingredient in baking.

### What does pea protein taste like?

Pea protein is said to have a mild, slightly earthy taste that doesn’t overpower. However, this can be easily disguised by mixing into recipes such as smoothies or porridge. Alternatively, you could opt for one of our flavours of pea protein, including chocolate mint, vanilla, and banana.

### Who should use pea protein isolate?

Pea protein isolate is a great choice for people with dietary restrictions, such as vegans and vegetarians. However, it’s also suitable for anyone looking to increase their daily protein intake.

### Which is better, pea or whey protein?

The choice between pea and whey protein ultimately depends on individual needs and preferences. While whey is a little more readily absorbed compared to pea, and pea is a more suitable option for those with dietary restrictions, they still share many of the same core benefits and are both great choices.
