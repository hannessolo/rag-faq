### Essential Amino Acids

Our premium blend of 9 essential amino acids (EAAs) in a mixable powder. Mix it with water or add it to your favourite shake to up your intake and support your nutritional goals.

Essential amino acids, or EAAs, are called that because your body can’t produce them naturally. You have to get them from your diet. Our Essential Amino Acids powder gives you all 9 EAAs in a convenient, mixable powder.

Our Essential Amino Acids formula is an exclusive blend containing all 9 EAAs: leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, methionine and histidine. \*Each 15g serving of unflavoured variant contains an incredible 5.3g of leucine.

\\

### Purpose

Our Essential Amino Acids formula is for anyone who wants to make sure they’re getting their daily dose of amino acids to support their training process. It’s especially good if you’re on a vegan or non-meat diet, as some amino acids are difficult to obtain from non-animal food sources. Mix it with water, or add a serving to your favourite shake to up your nutritional intake.

Directions

### Directions

Mix 1 scoop (approximately 15g) with 500ml water in a shaker bottle. Consume 1-3 servings daily.

Essential Amino Acids are best taken on an empty stomach for optimal absorption. Consume one 15g serving either pre-exercise or split between pre-exercise and during exercise. There is no real need to supplement with Essential Amino Acids on non-exercise days, especially if you are using a quality **Whey Protein**.
