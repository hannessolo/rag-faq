### Glucomannan (Konjac) Capsules 500mg

High quality glucomannan powder in a convenient capsule form, contributing to weight loss\* in the context of an energy restricted diet.

A common ingredient in slim pasta and rice formulas, glucomannan is a water soluble fibre sourced from the Amorphophalli konjac plant. These Glucomannan (Konjac) Capsules allow you to supplement glucomannan before mealtimes as part of your energy restricted diet.

\\

### Purpose

Our Glucomannan (Konjac) Capsules are suitable for anyone following a calorie controlled diet who is aiming to lose weight. Each dose should be taken with plenty of water, to ensure the glucomannan reaches the stomach. This product is not suitable for people who have swallowing difficulties, as the fibre expands.

\*Glucomannan contributes to weight loss in the context of an energy restricted diet. The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 3g of glucomannan in 3 doses of 1g (2 capsules) each, taken with 1-2 glasses of water before meals and in the context of an energy restricted diet.
