Mix 1 scoop (approximately 30g) Pure Whey Isolate™ 97 with 200ml water. We recommend 1-3 servings per day, but in accordance with your own protein requirements.

Please note that the high protein content of this product results in foaming. We suggest leaving the shake to stand for 1 minute before consuming so the foam can disperse.
