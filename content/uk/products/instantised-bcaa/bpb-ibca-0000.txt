### Instant BCAA

Great tasting, easy mixing branched chain amino acid powder, available in a range of delicious, refreshing flavours, providing a 2:1:1 ratio of leucine, isoleucine and valine BCAAs.

BCAAs comprise about a third of the protein in your muscles, but can’t be produced by the body alone, making them an essential amino acid. Our Instant BCAA formula provides you with a healthy hit of the 3 BCAAs, leucine, isoleucine and valine, available in refreshing flavours like cola, mixed berry and lemon & lime.

Our Instant BCAA powder uses a combination of leucine, isoleucine and valine in a measured 2:1:1 ratio, and can be used pre-, intra- or post-workout. Our formula uses the highest quality ingredients, and is instantised for easy mixing, making it the perfect BCAA supplement if you need a steady supply of amino acids throughout the day.

\\

### Purpose

Our Instant BCAA is for anyone who needs some extra amino acids in their diet, or wants to make sure they’re getting a steady supply every day, no matter what. It’s especially good if you’re on a vegan or meat-free diet, as vegan protein sources like nuts and grains generally have a lower BCAA content than foods like red meat and dairy products.

The best time to use our Instant BCAA is while you train. Simply take a serving to the gym and sip between sets and exercises.
