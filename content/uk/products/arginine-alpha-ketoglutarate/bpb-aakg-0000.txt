### Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate

100% pure, our Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate, provides the vital amino acid arginine in a highly bioavailable form. An ideal ingredient in any DIY pre-workout formula.

Arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide production in the body, making it a popular component in many pre-workout formulas. Arginine alpha-ketoglutarate (AAKG) is a highly bioavailable form of arginine, meaning your body can more readily absorb it. This pure AAKG powder makes it easy to add AAKG to your favourite pre-workout supplement, or even create your own DIY pre-workout blend.

Arginine alpha-ketoglutarate is composed of two arginine molecules attached to one alpha-ketoglutarate molecule, creating a form of arginine with superior bioavailability.

\\

### Purpose

Our arginine alpha-ketoglutarate powder is ideal for mixing in with your regular pre-workout blend if you feel like integrating AAKG into your pre-workout supplement. If you’re a more experienced trainer who creates their own personal nutritional formulas, this is an ideal addition to your DIY pre-workout blend.
