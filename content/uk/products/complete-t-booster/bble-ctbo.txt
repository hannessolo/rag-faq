Pure ingredients, potent doses and research proven. We created our T-Booster Capsules to provide a combination of vital nutrients and minerals that contribute to normal fertility and reproduction**, protein synthesis*** and testosterone levels in the blood*. T-Booster Capsules comprises 3 active ingredients in their purest, most potent forms, combined to provide the best possible results from all 3. D-Aspartic Acid: One of the hottest nutritional ingredients in sports nutrition and academia right now. Our Complete T-Booster™ supplement provides a massive 3000mg dose per serving, higher than the majority of competing products. Protodioscin: Most other Tribulus extracts only offer 20% saponins. We upped it to 50%. That means you get 1500mg in a single serving. Zinc: Zinc is an important mineral that plays a wide range of vital roles in your body’s function, including fertility and reproduction, as well as protein synthesis. We added an impressive 30mg dose of zinc in the form of zinc monomethionine. *Zinc contributes to the maintenance of normal testosterone levels in the blood. **Zinc contributes to normal fertility and reproduction ***Zinc contributes to normal protein synthesis. \ Purpose Our Complete T-Booster™ is designed for strength and power athletes looking to maintain normal blood testosterone levels*, as well as anyone concerned with maintaining normal fertility and reproduction**. \ Benefits Combined Action By blending unique ingredients with different purposes, you get the best potential in a single supplement.
