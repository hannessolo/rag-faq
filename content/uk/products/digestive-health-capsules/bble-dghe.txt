### Digestive Health Capsules

Do you feel like your digestive system could do with a helping hand? With an endless to-do list, it’s not surprising. Every morsel that passes your mouth embarks on a long journey. Food is broken down into the components needed for energy, growth, repair and the day-to-day functioning of your body. These capsules provide a comprehensive blend of 24 active ingredients to support this process.

And here are all the little helpers. Chloride contributes to normal digestion\*. Calcium contributes to digestive enzyme function\*\*. Three types of soluble and insoluble fibre, in the form of baobab powder, NuBana™ green banana flour and inulin from chicory. These have been paired with bacillus coagulans live cultures in the form of LactoSpore® and Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis lactis in the form of SynBalance® SmilinGut. DigeZyme® Plus provides Alpha-amylase, protease, cellulase, lipase and lactase to improve lactose digestion\*\*\*.

If you’re not impressed with that lot, we have more. Selenium contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress, chromium contributes to normal macronutrient metabolism and vitamin D contributes to the normal function of the immune system. This is topped off with a combination of fennel seed extract, peppermint oil, dill leaf, ginger root extract, artichoke extract and aloe vera extract.

Four capsules, before or after your main meal, is all it takes to give your digestive system some extra support.Our Digestive Health Capsules can be combined with other health and wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs. Suitable to take alongside Blood Sugar Health Capsules, if desired. They also work well with Cinnamon Extract Powder, Alpha Lipoic Acid Capsules and Psyllium Husk Powder.

\*Chloride contributes to normal digestion by production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.

\*\*Calcium contributes to the normal function of digestive enzymes.
