### Heart Health Capsules

The heart is an incredible organ. It beats away day and night our entire lives, pumping blood, oxygen and nutrients around the body. As the name suggests, our Heart Health Capsules provide a comprehensive range of ingredients for everything to do with the heart and blood. They are made with a synergistic combination of 13 vitamins, minerals and plant extracts.

Heart Health Capsules contain Thiamin, which contributes to the normal function of the heart\*, along with iron, which contributes to the normal formation of red blood cells and haemoglobin, as well as normal oxygen transport in the body\*\*. Each serving also provides 100% of your daily recommended intake of Vitamin K, in the form of vitaMK7®, which contributes to normal blood clotting. Finally, we’ve added Choline, Vitamin B6 and B12, all of which contribute to normal homocysteine metabolism. To complete the formula, each serving contains a full 250mg of Aged Black Garlic Extract in the form of ABG10+®, Trans-Resveratrol, Grape Seed Extract, Astragalus Root and CoEnzyme Q10.

These Heart Health Capsules are suitable for vegetarians and vegans and they’re incredibly convenient to use. Just take 2 capsules and you can get on with your day, safe in the knowledge that you’ve taken care of your heart. They can also be combined with other health & wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs.
