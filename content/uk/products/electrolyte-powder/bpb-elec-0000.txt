### Electrolyte Powder

GET BACK WHAT YOU SWEAT OUT

Our Electrolyte Powder is a comprehensive blend of minerals your body sweats out during intense training.

Every scoop is dosed with three key electrolytes — sodium, potassium and calcium — that are essential for a number of your body’s functions.

WHY SHOULD I TAKE IT?

Everytime you train hard, you’re sweating out minerals your body needs. Our Electrolyte Powder has a multi-mineral blend that’s ideal for endurance training or intense workouts all in one refreshing drink.

WHY IT WORKS

Available at a moment’s notice, just scoop, shake and you're ready to go.

It’s easy to incorporate into your normal routine, with delicious flavours to enjoy or you can throw it into your usual shake with our unflavoured version too.
