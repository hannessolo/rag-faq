### Liver Health Capsules

The liver is a warrior of an organ that we so often overlook. Over 500 essential functions happen here; including bile production, cholesterol production, glycogen storage and the breakdown of medications and toxic compounds. Liver Health Capsules from Bulk™ provide a comprehensive range of ingredients to support your liver, with a blend of vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, antioxidants, plant extracts and amino acids.

Liver Health Capsules provide 82.5mg choline from Vitacholine®, which contributes to normal liver function\*. They also provide Vitamins B6 and B12, which contribute to normal homocysteine metabolism\*\*, as well as Vitamin E, Riboflavin and Selenium, which contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. The vitamins and minerals are complemented by a range of popular ingredients including a full 250mg of Aged Black Garlic Extract, in the form of ABG10+®, N-Acetyl L-Cysteine, Artichoke Extract, L-Glutamine, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Soya Lecithin, L-Glutathione, Quercetin, Bioperine® and Broccoli Extract, which provides Sulforaphane.

Liver Health Capsules are suitable for vegetarians and vegans and they’re incredibly convenient to use.
