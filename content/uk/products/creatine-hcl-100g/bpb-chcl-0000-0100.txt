### Creatine HCL - Unflavoured 100g

Premium creatine bonded with a hydrochloride salt to enhance absorption. An ideal addition to post-workout formulas and protein shakes.

Creatine is the most researched sports supplement on the market today, and has been shown to increase physical performance in successive bursts of short term, high intensity exercise\*. This Creatine HCL provides a form of creatine bonded with hydrochloride salt, designed to enhance the absorption of creatine, providing 3g of 100% creatine hydrochloride in a 3g serving.

Creatine is a non-essential compound that can be obtained through your diet or synthesised in the liver, pancreas and kidneys, but not to the levels required to enhance creatine stores in the muscle. As a result, it’s common for athletes to supplement with creatine. Creatine HCL is an ideal supplement choice for trainers who want creatine with optimum absorption, making it a perfect choice for serious bodybuilders, powerlifters, rugby players or anyone who engages in short term, successive bursts of high intensity exercise.

\*Creatine increases physical performance in successive bursts of short-term, high intensity exercise. The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 3 g of creatine.

\\

### Purpose

Creatine isn’t just the most researched training supplement on the market, it’s also one of the most popular. Our Creatine HCL is for anyone who wants to integrate creatine into their everyday nutritional intake with optimal absorption. We recommend consuming 3-5g of creatine after every workout for optimal intake, as well as on rest days to maintain uptake. We also recommend consuming it with a fast-releasing carbohydrate, such as dextrose, so your body has the energy to recover from your workouts. For every gram of creatine you consume, aim to drink at least 75ml of water to aid absorption.

\\

### Benefits

*   Ready for Recovery

Ideally taken after every workout, as well as on rest days, to promote creatine uptake.

*   Morning, Noon or Night

Great any time of day, whatever your workout regime.

*   Do It Yourself

An ideal ingredient if you’re making your own personal supplement formula.

*   Post-Workout Perfecton

An ideal addition to post-workout formulas.

*   Made for Mixing

Unflavoured for easy mixing with your favourite post-workout shake.

Directions
----------

### Directions
