### Protein Spread

Introducing our Protein Spread, the delicious, creamy, no-added-sugar alternative to your regular supermarket-grade toast-topper. These delightful spread stack up very favourably compared to the spread that you’re used to. Featuring zero palm oil, at least 19g protein per 100g and a huge amount of flavour, they’re here to change up the breakfast game.

They are made with real nuts and feature a blend of rapeseed and shea instead of the usual palm. You can choose from a classic Chocolate Hazelnut flavour, branch out with White Chocolate Hazelnut flavour or try something completely new with White Chocolate Pistachio flavour.

Protein Spread are great for topping pancakes, porridge and toast as well as for eating straight off the spoon - we promise not to judge! This versatile and delicious snack is suitable for any occasion and will have you coming back to the cupboard to see what else you can add it to.

\*Contains naturally occurring sugars.
