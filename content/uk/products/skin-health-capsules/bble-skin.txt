### Skin Health Capsules

Our skin is a natural barrier and our first line of defence against many types of bacteria and other undesirable pathogens. The skincare market is flooded with topical products but from everything we’ve seen at Bulk™, there’s space for a market-leading, complete nutritional formula to take centre-stage. Enter our Skin Health Capsules. With a potent combination of 19 vitamins, minerals, plant extracts, antioxidants and amino acids to aid a range of functions within the skin.

Skin Health Capsules are high in Iodine and Niacin, both of which contribute to the maintenance of normal skin. This has been combined with 100% of your recommended daily intake of Vitamin C, which contributes to normal collagen formation for the normal function of skin\*. Next up, Vitamin A has been included, which contributes to the maintenance of normal mucous membranes. Riboflavin and Zinc contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress, whilst Copper contributes to normal skin pigmentation\*\*. Take a breath after that all as we’re not done, the formula has been completed with 1000mg of Naticol 4000® Marine Collagen, Oleuropein from Olive Leaf Extract, Cocoa Extract, Pomegranate Extract, L-Ornithine, L-Serine, L-Methionine, L-Cysteine, Proanthocyanidins from Pine Bark Extract Rosehip Extract, Sea Buckthorn and Bioperine®.

Skin Health Capsules are incredibly convenient to use. Just take 4 capsules daily, preferably with meals. They can also be combined with other health & wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs. We included Naticol 4000® as the collagen source in this product. This decision was driven by our desire to do better for the planet, as it is produced by enzymatic hydrolysis from fish skins that would otherwise be discarded in the fillet process. Helping to reduce food waste, whilst giving a strong dose of Type 1 Collagen seemed like a win-win for us.

\\
