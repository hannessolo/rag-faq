### Informed Whey Protein

The very best whey protein shake from **Bulk™**  created for elite athletes. Each serving of Informed Whey® is packed with over 24g of mTOR Whey Complex™, 3g of leucine and 3g of glutamine peptides, as well as DigeZyme®’s unique enzyme complex. It’s lab tested for banned substances and nutritional standards, and available in a range of delicious, gourmet flavours. If you don’t love it, we’ll give you your money back\*.

Our Informed Whey® formula is designed to be the best whey protein shake money can buy, created in compliance with international competition standards for professional athletes. We test every single batch for banned substances and impurities, list every ingredient in detail, and rigorously test it for nutritional consistency. That means total transparency, so you know exactly how you’re fuelling your body.

Using a precise blend of high-quality whey protein, glutamine peptides, leucine and digestive enzymes, including exclusive and proprietary formulas, Informed Whey® is the ultimate whey protein shake for serious trainers:

*   **mTOR Protein Complex™:** Informed Whey® contains 24g per serving of our exclusive mTOR protein complex which, unlike most other formulas, uses premium whey protein isolate as its primary protein source (65%) with whey protein concentrate as a secondary source (35%).
*   **DigeZyme® Digestive Enzymes:** Digestive enzymes help to break down protein, carbohydrate, cellulose and fat. DigeZyme® is a popular blend of five digestive enzymes: protease, amylase, lipase, lactase and cellulase.
*   **LactoSpore®:** LactoSpore®’s preparation is a high quality, superior source of Bacillus coagulans.
*   **Glutamine Peptides:** Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle. Our Informed WHEY® formula contains 3g of glutamine peptides per serving.

\\
