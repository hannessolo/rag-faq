### FAQs

### What does ZMA do?

ZMA is a supplement that combines zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6. It is often taken to help support normal testosterone levels.

### Does ZMA increase testosterone?

ZMA does not function as a direct testosterone booster for healthy individuals. However, zinc plays a role in maintaining normal testosterone levels in the blood, making it more beneficial for men with zinc deficiency or low testosterone levels, as it may have a more noticeable testosterone-boosting effect in those cases.

### Should you take ZMA every night?

It is generally recommended to take ZMA before bedtime (approximately 30-60 minutes before) on an empty stomach.

### Who should take ZMA?

ZMA is typically used by athletes, bodybuilders, and anyone who is engaged in regular physical activity. However, ZMA is suitable for anyone who wishes to increase their intake of these nutrients.
