### Vitamin K2 Tablets 75μg

This little number (or letter) may be under the radar, but it shouldn’t be underestimated. Its main roles include contributing to bone health\* and normal blood clotting\*\*. We only need a small amount of Vitamin K each day to make a big difference. A miniscule 75 micrograms of this essential fat-soluble vitamin is all it takes. So you’d think this would be a walk in a park. Not quite.

Vitamin K occurs naturally in two forms. The most common is K1 (phylloquinone), and the benefits are widely known. Mainly found in leafy greens, cereals and vegetable oils, many of us are happy to munch our way through more than the recommended intake of K1 each day.

K2 (menaquinone), on the other hand, is a little more challenging. Small quantities are found in egg yolks, dairy, meat and fermented foods, so it’s not easy to reach the ideal target. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, most of those sources are ruled out. Enter this little tablet.

Our Vitamin K2 tablets are packed with 75μg K2, which equates to 100% of your daily recommended intake.The K2 in these tablets is in the form of MK-7, one of the most widely researched forms of menaquinone. All you need is one tablet. Once a day. It’s that simple.

\*Vitamin K contributes to the maintenance of normal bones.

\*\*Vitamin K contributes to normal blood clotting.
