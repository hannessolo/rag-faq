### Natural Pure Whey Isolate™

What you see is what you get. All the benefits of our popular Pure Whey Isolate™, except this formula is naturally sweetened with Stevia plant extract. If you’re looking to increase your protein intake as part of a healthy, balanced lifestyle and prefer a more natural approach to your nutrition, this one’s for you.

Just like our Pure Whey Isolate™, this natural alternative is incredibly versatile. Shake up a smoothie with fresh fruit, nuts and seeds. Bake into brownies, blondies, muffins and more. Stir into porridge or pimp up your pancakes. Back to basics? Just add water or milk.

Choose from classic Vanilla, Chocolate or Strawberry flavours. You’ll find at least 24g protein in every serving and less than 111 calories. It’s also low in sugar (0.4g per serving) and low in fat (less than 0.4g per serving).
