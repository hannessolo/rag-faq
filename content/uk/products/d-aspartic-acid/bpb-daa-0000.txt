### D Aspartic Acid

100% pure D aspartic acid powder at an exceptional price, providing a convenient way to supplement your body’s intake of aspartic acid amino acid.

D aspartic acid is the D-form of the amino acid aspartic acid, produced naturally in the body from the non-essential amino acid l-aspartic acid. D aspartic acid is particularly popular among male strength athletes and bodybuilders, and our D Aspartic Acid provides an easy way to add extra D aspartic acid into your diet.

D aspartic acid is found throughout the human body in high concentrations in areas where hormone production takes place. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland and testes all have high concentrations of D aspartic acid.

\\

### Purpose

D aspartic acid powder is ideal if you want to supplement your diet with additional D aspartic acid. It’s a particularly popular supplement for male bodybuilders and strength athletes.

\\

### Benefits

*   Made for Mixing

Ideal for mixing with your favourite shakes and smoothies.

*   Do It Yourself

An ideal ingredient if you’re making your own personal supplement formula.

*   Incredible Value

100% pure D aspartic acid powder at a great price.

Directions
----------

### Directions

Mix 1 slightly heaped scoop (approximately 3g) with 50ml water in a **Bulk™** Shaker Bottle, either in the morning or before bed.

We suggest using D-Aspartic Acid powder for 4-8 weeks at a time, then discontinuing use for 4-8 weeks before commencing another cycle. This will prevent your body from becoming too acclimatised to D-Aspartic Acid and ensure optimal results.

Consume 1 serving per day.
