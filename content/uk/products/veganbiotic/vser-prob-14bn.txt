### Veganbiotic

A unique multi-strain formula of 16 live cultures, combined with inulin. Provides an ideal dose of vegan-friendly live cultures in a convenient 2 capsule serving, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains.

Our Veganbiotic™ supplement allows people following a vegan or animal-free diet to supplement a broad spectrum of bacteria that naturally occur in the gut.

Our Veganbiotic™ has been formulated in partnership with experts in the field to provide a complete dose of cultures to complement a vegan diet. That’s why it contains an incredible 16 strains in a single blend, ranging from the popular Lactobacillus acidophilus to lesser-known strains like Bifidobacterium breve, providing a cumulative 16 billion CFU (Colony Forming Units) of live cultures in 2 capsules. On top of that, we’ve combined these cultures with 400mg of inulin, a dietary fibre that’s commonly found in foods like pulses and vegetables, and is a popular partner to probiotic cultures.

*   ****Inulin**** Inulin belongs to a class of dietary fibres called fructans. Part of a unique group of naturally occurring polysaccharides, it’s non-digestible in the gut, passing through your stomach and small intestine unchanged. Inulin is often supplemented alongside live cultures, making it an ideal ingredient in our Veganbiotic™.
*   **Synbalance® Veganbiotic™** A multi-strain blend of 16 live cultures of bacteria, all of which occur naturally in the gut. Veganbiotic™ contains 10 strains of Lactobacillus, 5 strains of Bifidobacterium and 1 strain of Streptococcus, providing an incredible 16 billion CFU in a 2 capsule serving – roughly double the dose of other leading products.

\\
