### Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate

A premium whey protein with a difference, our Hydrolysed Whey Protein has been filtered to create the purest formula you’ll find. If you’re looking to increase your protein intake as part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle, this is a winning choice.

And the benefits don’t stop there. Bring this A-lister to your baking to make premium protein cookies, flapjacks or brownies. Add some style to your smoothies and blend in some goji berries and coconut flakes. Simply add water or milk and your high-performing protein shake is ready to go.

Choose from classic Chocolate or Strawberry flavours, or try adding fresh berries to Unflavoured and make it your own.

Let’s take a closer look inside. Based on Chocolate flavour, each serving is packed with 24g protein and just 110 calories. It’s also low in sugar (0.4g per serving) and low in fat (0.4g per serving).

Ready to dive deeper? Treated with a unique enzyme process, this is the fastest-absorbing whey protein isolate available. Our Hydrolysed Whey Protein uses a unique form of thermal processing called enzymatic hydrolysis, which breaks down longer protein chains into small chain peptides.
