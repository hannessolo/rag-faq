### Colostrum

High quality colostrum formula, ethically sourced in small batches and collected in the first 12 hours for maximum nutrient density. Each 10g serving contains a minimum 30% immunoglobulin G (IgG) content, plus a wealth of additional nutrition.

Our Colostrum 30% Active IgG is a premium, ethically sourced colostrum formula. It’s rich in IgG, a type of antibody, with a minimum 30% content in every batch. Our colostrum is ethically sourced in small batches to ensure an ample supply of milk remains, and is prepared with a low heat spray dry to ensure the product is non-denatured.

Immunoglobulin G, or IgG for short, is a potent antibody. We use a process called Radial Immunodiffusion (RID) to measure the IgG content of our colostrum, ensuring every batch contains a minimum 30% IgG content. Our Colostrum 30% Active IgG formula is also rich in protein, providing 8g of protein in a single 10g serving.
