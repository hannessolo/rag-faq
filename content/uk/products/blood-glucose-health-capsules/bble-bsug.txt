### Blood Glucose Health Capsules

Our body works incredibly hard to keep blood glucose in check, largely through the action of the hormones insulin. Over the course of an average day, blood glucose and the corresponding hormones will fluctuate up, down and so on. Blood Glucose Health Capsules offer a tailored blend of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and plant extracts to support a range of functions within the body.

Blood Glucose Health Capsules provide 250μg Chromium, which contributes to normal blood glucose levels.They also provide Biotin and Zinc, both of which contribute to normal macronutrient metabolism\*; as well as Copper and Manganese, which both contribute to normal energy-yielding metabolism and the protection of cells from oxidative stress. The vitamins and minerals are rounded-out with a full 250mg of Aged Black Garlic Extract, in the form of ABG10+®, Cinnamon Extract, Panax Ginseng, Inulin, Green Tea Extract, Inositol and Bioperine®.

Blood Glucose Health Capsules are suitable for vegetarians and vegans and they’re incredibly convenient to use. Just take 2 capsules daily, preferably with meals. They can also be combined with other health & wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs.
