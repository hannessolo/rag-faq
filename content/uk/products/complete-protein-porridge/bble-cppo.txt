### Protein Porridge Mix

This isn’t your average porridge. This one is powered with protein to get you ahead of your goals. Our Protein Porridge Mix is also fibre rich with minimal sugar. Now that’s how to kickstart your day.

Every nutritious bowl packs in at least 21g protein\* (to support the growth and maintenance of muscle\*\*) and 20g fibre. This multi-protein blend combines whey and milk protein to give you the benefits of both fast and slow-release proteins. Whey protein contains more leucine and digests in around 30 minutes. Milk protein contains more isoleucine and lysine and digests at a slower rate than whey protein. Milk protein also contains casein which is responsible for the slower rate of digestion.

Choose from Golden Syrup, Strawberry and Apple & Cinnamon, or keep it simple with Unflavoured. Wake up and make those gains.

\\

### Purpose
