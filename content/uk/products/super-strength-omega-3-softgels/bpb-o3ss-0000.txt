Description

### Super Strength Omega 3

High purity omega 3 softgel capsules, packed with a powerful 330mg of EPA and 220mg of DHA per dose, promoting normal function of the heart.

As the name suggests, these Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels are loaded with essential fatty acids (EFAs) that you can only obtain from food or supplements. They offer a higher EFA content than typical omega 3 supplements.

Our Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels contain EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), essential fatty acids primarily sourced from cold water fish such as tuna, mackerel, trout and halibut.

\*Regular doses of 250mg EPA and DHA every day contribute to normal functioning of the heart.

\\

### Purpose

Omega 3 fish oils contain essential fatty acids that can’t be synthesised by the human body (they can only be ingested from food and supplements), and they help to promote normal heart function, so our Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels 1000mg are intended to supplement any healthy diet and lifestyle.

\\

### Benefits

*   Healthy Heart
