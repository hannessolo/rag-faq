### Kidney Health Capsules

Two little bean-shaped organs. Often overlooked, the kidneys shouldn’t be underestimated. Their job to keep your body clean is vital. There’s no time off. They work around the clock to filter waste and extra fluid, while maintaining a healthy balance of minerals and regulating blood pH levels. These capsules provide a comprehensive blend of 24 active ingredients to support the health of these essential organs.

So, what’s inside? Juniper berry\* and parsley\*\*\* contribute to the excretory function of the kidneys. Rose hip supports kidney and bladder health\*\*. Vitamin C contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. Plus a botanical bonanza of cranberry extract, moringa, asparagus extract, chlorella, astragalus extract, pine bark extract, fennel seed extract, horsetail, olive leaf extract, elderberry extract, green tea extract and rosemary leaf extract. Thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, folic acid and vitamin B12 complete the formula. Feel better for just reading that list of ingredients?

Four capsules a day is all it takes to give your kidneys some extra support.

Our Kidney Health Capsules can be combined with other health and wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs. Suitable to take alongside Liver Health Capsules or Blood Sugar Health Capsules, if desired. They also work well with a good omega 3 supplement. We recommend Prom3ga™ or Vegan Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels from our premium range.

\*Juniper Berry supports the excretory function of the kidneys.

\*\*Rose Hip supports kidney and bladder health.

\*\*\*Parsley supports the excretory function of the kidneys.
