### Collagen & Vitamin C

#### YOUR SKINCARE ROUTINE’S NEW ADDITION

This is skin-care simplified. Our collagen has been hydrolysed and blended with Vitamin C — meaning it’s optimised for easy absorption. So all you have to do is shake up whichever flavour (or unflavoured) you fancy and enjoy all of the benefits.

#### Why should I take it?

Skin is amazing. It’s our body's largest organ, there to protect us from harmful bacteria and chemicals. So it’s natural we would want to do what we can to keep it healthy. And our Collagen & Vitamin C Powder does exactly that. Contributing to the growth and maintenance of muscle mass, as well as the normal function of collagen formation, bones and cartilage, skin, gums, teeth, and blood vessels.

#### Why it works

\- 12g hydrolysed collagen protein per serving\* that contributes to your skin’s strength

\- Type 1 and Type 3 collagen protein\*\* that helps repair and maintain your muscles

\- 24mg Vitamin C per serving\*\*\*

\- With 5 flavours, it’s easy to combine consistently into your routine

\- Blends beautifully with your favourite foods and drinks, making it a breeze to take

\*Protein contributes to the growth of muscle mass.
