### Glutamine Peptides

100% glutamine peptides powder, providing pure glutamine peptides in a convenient powder form, ideal for mixing with your favourite shakes or DIY workout formula.

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid found in muscle, and a conditionally essential amino acid. Basically, that means that the body can synthesise it naturally, but your body’s levels of glutamine sometimes deplete faster than they can be replenished, such as during strenuous exercise. This glutamine peptides powder provides an easy way to integrate glutamine supplements into your post-workout protein shakes so you’ve always got a steady supply in your nutrition.

As the name suggests, Glutamine Peptides is a peptide-bonded form of glutamine, which simply makes the product more stable, particularly when mixed with other ingredients and products.

\\

### Purpose

As a quick and easy way of replenishing your body’s glutamine levels, our glutamine peptides powder is an ideal addition to any post-workout shake, whether added to your favourite product or as part of your own personal DIY blend.
