### B Vitamin Complex Tablets

Every single essential B vitamin compiled into a single, easy tablet, providing your complete recommended intake alongside a selection of additional nutrients.

B vitamins are some of the most vital vitamins in your diet, supporting a whole range of bodily processes. This simple tablet supplement helps you get your daily dosage every day with zero hassle.

Our B Vitamin Complex Tablets provide you with 100% (or more) of your recommended intake of every B vitamin, as well as biotin, inositol, PABA and choline, which are commonly grouped in with B vitamins more broadly.

**Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)**

Contributes to normal energy yielding metabolism, nervous system function, psychological function and heart function.

**Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)**

Contributes to normal energy yielding metabolism, nervous system function, maintenance of normal mucous membranes, iron metabolism, normal vision, maintenance of red blood cells and normal skin maintenance.

**Vitamin B3 (Niacin)**

Helps to reduce tiredness and fatigue, as well as normal nervous system function and energy yielding metabolism.

**Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)**

Contributes to normal cognitive function, as well as synthesis and metabolism of steroid hormones, vitamin D and a range of neurotransmitters.

**Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)\***

Helps to reduce tiredness and fatigue, as well as contributing to normal protein, glycogen and energy-yielding metabolism.

**Vitamin B7 (Biotin, Vitamin H, CoEnzyme R)**

Biotin contributes to maintenance of normal skin and hair as well as macronutrient metabolism.

**Vitamin B8 (Inositol, Myoinositol)**

Our B Vitamin Complex Tablets use inositol in its myoinositol form.

**Vitamin B9 (Folic Acid, Folate, Vitamin M, Pteroyl-L-Glutamate)**

Folate contributes to maternal tissue growth during pregnancy, as well as normal amino acid synthesis.

**Vitamin B10 (Para Aminobenzoic Acid, 4-Aminobenzoic Acid)**

An organic compound more commonly known as PABA.

**Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)**

Vitamine B12 contributes to normal red blood cell formation, as well as energy-yielding metabolism and psychological function

**Choline**

While technically not a B-vitamin, choline is closely linked with the vitamin B family, so we added it into our formula to provide you with the complete profile.
