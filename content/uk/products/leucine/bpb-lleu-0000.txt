### Leucine

100% pure leucine powder, an easy way to integrate this essential branched chain amino acid into your pre-, intra- and post-workout formulas for optimal nutrition, any time of day.

Leucine is an essential amino acid and one of 3 branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), commonly found in high protein foods such as red meat and dairy products. Our pure leucine powder is a great way to integrate extra leucine into your dietary intake, either mixed with your favourite formulas, or as part of your own DIY blend.

Along with isoleucine and valine, leucine is one of the 3 BCAAs that are essential nutrition for any regular athlete and trainer. We offer it in this pure, mixable formula so you can mix it in with your favourite training formulas, whether pre-, intra- or post-workout, and ensure you’re getting sustained BCAAs throughout every session.

### Purpose

As an essential amino acid and BCAA, leucine is an excellent supplement for anyone who exercises regularly, whatever their sport or pastime. It’s a great ingredient in workout formulas of all forms, whether pre-, intra- or post-workout, and we recommend using it in combination with other BCAAs, beta alanine, fast release carbohydrates such as Vitargo®, glutamine, creatine, and a high quality protein source.
