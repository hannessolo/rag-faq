### FAQs

### What are knee sleeves good for?

Knee sleeves provide compression to the knee joint, which increases blood flow and helps to keep the knees warm during workouts. They can also help to stabilise the knee joint during exercises like squats, reducing discomfort and improving form, particularly in the bottom position.

### When should you not wear knee sleeves?

While knee sleeves can be beneficial for exercises like squats, clean and jerks, and snatches, they are not needed for all weightlifting activities. If you are not using your knees during an exercise, then knee sleeves may not be necessary.

### Are knee sleeves good for weightlifting?

Knee sleeves provide compression, support, and alignment to crucial parts of the knee joint, which can help reduce pain and improve technique. They are popular among Olympic weightlifters and powerlifters for these reasons.

### Should I Deadlift with knee sleeves?

No, knee sleeves should not be used for deadlifts due to the excessive compression they provide. While some compression can be beneficial for warmth and stability, too much can cause the lift to feel unnatural.
