### Vegan Mass Gainer

The ultimate vegan-friendly formula for trainers on weight gain programmes, containing over 30g of vegan protein and 40g of complex carbohydrates per serving, plus a range of essential nutrients and supplements.

The result of an intense process of research and refinement, our Vegan Mass Gainer is the very best weight gainer formula on the market, containing all the protein, carbs and calories you need in a precise formula.

Our Vegan Mass Gainer uses our V+™ protein blend, containing an incredible 5 protein sources, to provide you with a complete protein intake. On top of that, we use ultra fine oats to provide a complex carbohydrate source, as well as goMCT™ vegan MCTs and digestive enzymes to reinforce your nutritional intake.

*   **V+™ plant-based Protein Blend** Each serving of our Vegan Mass Gainer contains over 30g of our proprietary protein blend, consisting of super pea protein isolate, brown rice protein, pumpkin protein, flaxseed powder and quinoa flour, providing a more complete protein intake than single-source formulas.
*   **Ultra Fine Oats** Oats provide a carbohydrate source that fuels the body with a slow, sustained release, as well as additional fibre.
*   **goMCT™** A vegan-friendly form of medium chain triglycerides, goMCT™ is sourced from coconut oil and acacia gum.
*   **DigeZyme® Digestive Enzymes** Digestive Enzymes help to break down protein, carbohydrate, cellulose and fat. DigeZyme® is a popular blend of five digestive enzymes: protease, amylase, lipase, lactase and cellulase.
