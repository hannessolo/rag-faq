### Lion’s Mane Capsules 500mg

The mighty mushroom is becoming an increasingly popular nootropic supplement. Regally named, the lion’s mane (_Hericium erinaceus_) is one of the most well-known and widely used edible mushrooms you’ll find.

And it deserves a proper introduction. Native to North America, Europe and Asia, the beautifully formed head of a lion’s mane mushroom has been enjoyed as a food for decades. It’s also been used in traditional Chinese medicine and more recently as a supplement in Western culture. When you see a cluster growing in all its glory, the name becomes clear.

Time for some science. When taking mushrooms as supplements, here’s what to look out for. First are the active components called polysaccharides, which are found in the cell walls of fungi. Beta-glucans, the most well-known fungal polysaccharide, are a soluble fibre broken down in the intestine. Each capsule contains a potent 150mg polysaccharides (standardised 30% dosage). Second is the strength of the extract. These are dosed at a 12:1, so 500mg lion’s mane extract per capsule is the equivalent to 6g fresh mushroom.

\\
