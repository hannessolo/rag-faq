### Soya Protein Isolate

You might be plant-based. You might be dairy-free. Either way, our Soya Protein Isolate won’t disappoint. And with nothing else added (Unflavoured), you have the freedom to make it your own. Shake up a storm with wild berries and a sprinkle of seeds. Mix into home-baked brownies, muffins or flapjacks. Add some punch to your pancakes or pimp up your porridge. Go solo and just add water or milk. Bring more protein to a healthy, balanced lifestyle the plant-based way.

If you fancy some flavour, choose from Vanilla, Chocolate, Salted Caramel or Banana. Pure and simple? Unflavoured all the way.

Each serving contains at least 24g protein. You’ll find less than 0.7g sugar, less than 0.5g fat and under 110 calories per serving.

And only the best is good enough. We use a premium soya protein isolate derived from soybeans. It’s also expertly formulated with one of the highest PDCAAS (Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score) possible, scoring 1.0.
