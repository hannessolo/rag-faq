### Powdered Peanut Butter

Nutty about peanut butter, but not so keen on the calories? We’ve created this just for you. All the flavour of your favourite spread without the extra weight. You can save that for your next gym session.

This ingenious creation contains 70% less fat than traditional peanut butter\*. If you’re not impressed with those numbers, we’d be a little surprised. But we’ve also kept the protein and fibre content high. That’s what we call a win.

Now for the fun bit. Simply add water, as much or as little as you like, to create a smooth and creamy butter. Choose the consistency you like. Perfect with porridge or pancakes. A tasty topping for toast. Pimp up your protein shake or smoothie. It’s time to get creative.
