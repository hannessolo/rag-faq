### Vitargo

100% Vitargo®, a world patented sports carbohydrate, providing an incredible 70g of rapidly absorbing carbs in a single 75g serving. Ideal for strength and endurance athletes who need optimal carb replenishment before, during and after intensive workouts.

Vitargo® is a world patented sports carbohydrate, formulated to provide a faster release and absorption than standard carbohydrates, making it an ideal training supplement. This Vitargo® supplement provides pure Vitargo®, so you can mix it in with your favourite shakes, smoothies and snacks for a quick carb boost.

Vitargo® is produced from amylopectin maize starch, modified through a patented formula to create a larger carbohydrate molecule that moves through the digestive tract much faster than sugar-based carbohydrates.
