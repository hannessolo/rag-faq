### Micellar Casein

Easy-mixing micellar casein powder, from a premium source with an impressive amino acid profile. This powder packs an incredible at least 77% protein content, available in 3 delicious flavours or unflavoured for combining with your favourite formula.

Our Micellar Casein is a high quality, premium casein made from ultra-filtered skimmed milk. It’s ideal if you’re training on a meat-free diet, whether you’re a beginner or a regular, or if you’re just looking for some alternative protein sources to supplement your regular diet.

Micellar casein is a slow-releasing protein source, perfect for mixing with other protein supplements like whey protein and pea protein. It’s especially popular as a before bed supplement, or for use during the day when you might not eat for a while.
