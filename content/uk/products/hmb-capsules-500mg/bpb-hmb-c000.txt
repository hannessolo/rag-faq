### HMB Capsules 500mg

500mg of HMB in a convenient capsule form, a popular additional supplement for your post-workout nutritional intake.

HMB is an active metabolite of the branched chain amino acid leucine – in other words, it’s one of the chemicals your body produces as it metabolises leucine. Since the 1990s, it’s been a common ingredient in all-in-one shakes. Some people find the taste of HMB unpleasant, so these HMB Capsules help you get a nutritional dose of HMB in an easy-to-eat form – perfect for washing down with your regular post-workout shake.

HMB is an abbreviation of beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate. Although it’s similar to leucine, the two are metabolised differently, with HMB being produced by the liver enzyme ketoisocaproate. Increased leucine consumption generally only results in modest increased HMB levels, hence why many trainers choose to supplement both.

\\

### Purpose

HMB is a great addition to post-workout formulas, especially in combination with protein, BCAAs, carbohydrates and creatine – which is why these capsules are great for taking with your regular post-workout shake.
