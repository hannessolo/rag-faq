### Cognizin® Capsules

Cognizin® Capsules are a patented form of citicoline. This is a supplemental source of choline, which is a substance naturally found in the brain. It’s essential to human life to help raise the levels of important neurotransmitters (your body’s version of instant messaging). It’s not officially a vitamin or mineral, but it has a lot in common with the B vitamin family. Like close friends, they share similar traits. Let’s take a closer look.

Acetylcholine (a compound of acetic acid and a molecule of choline) is one of these neurotransmitters and is in charge of memory, mood, muscle control and other brain and nervous system functions. Although choline is produced by the body, there are times when it needs a little help from diet or supplementation.

Rich sources of choline are meat and dairy. Although there are plant-based options, including nuts and seeds, vegans and vegetarians may find it harder to top up on supplies through diet.

There are a number of choline supplements available (including choline bitartrate, phosphatidylcholine and citicoline), but this ultra-premium trademarked Cognizin®; is particularly effective at getting to work.
