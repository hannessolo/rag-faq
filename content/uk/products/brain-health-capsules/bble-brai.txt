### Brain Health Capsules

Brain Health Capsules

You might think the brain is so clever it looks after itself. Not quite. Just like every other part of your body, it needs some TLC. Your brain is the head honcho. Literally. Sitting proudly on top. In charge. Making you who you are. Whether you’re sleeping, eating, scrolling through social media or stretching after a gym session, your brain is multitasking to make sure everything runs smoothly. These capsules provide a comprehensive, caffeine-free blend of 24 active ingredients to support cognitive health.

Let’s take a little look at what’s inside. Zinc, iron and iodine contribute to normal cognitive function. Pantothenic acid contributes to normal mental performance. Copper, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folic acid, vitamin B12 and vitamin C all contribute to normal function of the nervous system. To top it off, this jam-packed formula also contains ginkgo biloba, bacopa monnieri, VitaCholine™, anthocyanins, Acetyl-L-carnitine, green tea extract, phosphatidylserine, trans-resveratrol, CoQ10, quercetin, sage extract and BioPerine®. That little voice in your head will thank you for this lot.

Three capsules a day is all it takes to give your brain some extra support.

Our Brain Health Capsules can be combined with other health and wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs. A good omega 3 supplement is another cornerstone of healthy cognitive practice, as DHA contributes to the maintenance of normal brain function. We would recommend Prom3ga™ or Vegan Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels from our premium range.

\*Iron contributes to normal cognitive function.
