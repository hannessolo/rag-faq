A high quality, all-round blend of whey protein, maltodextrin carbohydrates, leucine and glutamine peptides amino acids, and creatine monohydrate, all in one single, convenient, delicious formula – everything your body needs in that crucial post-workout period.

Each serving contains an impressive 35g of protein, as well as 20g carbohydrate, 7.5g glutamine peptides, 5g leucine and 5g creatine monohydrate.

\*Carbohydrates contribute to the recovery of normal muscle function after highly intensive and/or long-lasting physical exercise leading to muscle fatigue and the depletion of glycogen stores in skeletal muscle. The beneficial effect is obtained with the consumption of carbohydrates, from all sources, at a total intake of 4g per kg body weight, at doses, within the first 4 hours and no later than 6 hours, following highly intensive and/or long-lasting physical exercise leading to muscle fatigue and the depletion of glycogen stores in skeletal muscle.

\*\*Protein contributes to growth and maintenance of muscle mass.
