### Beef Protein Isolate 97

If you’re looking for an alternative to whey protein, or following a strict Paleo Diet, Beef Protein Isolate 97 (HydroBEEF™) is just for you. Shake up a smoothie with nut butter and seeds, stir into porridge or simply add water or milk. Ready to bake? Power-up your homemade brownies, cookies or muffins.

The options don’t stop there. Choose from Chocolate, Chocolate Peanut or Banana Fudge flavours. If you like to keep it simple, go for Unflavoured.

Each serving packs in at least 27g protein and less than 123 calories. Beef Protein Isolate 97 (HydroBEEF™) is also low in sugar (less than 1g per serving) and low in fat (less than 0.9g per serving).

And because quality is always at the top of our list, this premium formula is made from HydroBEEF™ - a complete and premium protein, with an impressive 97% protein content, sourced from fresh European beef. Hydrolysised to make it super soluble, this is one of the purest protein sources you’ll find.

### Purpose

If you’re looking for an alternative to whey proteins, or following a strict Paleo Diet, Beef Protein Isolate 97 has been created just for you. Enjoy this premium protein boost as part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle.

Because of its high purity, some people may find the Unflavoured formula unpleasant to taste. We would recommend mixing with your favourite shake or smoothie, or choosing one of the delicious flavours.

### Directions

Mix 1 heaped scoop (30g) with 200ml water and shake well. We recommend 1-3 servings per day, but in accordance with your own protein requirements.

Please note that the high protein content of this product results in foaming. We suggest leaving the shake to stand for 1 minute before consuming so the foam can disperse.

You could enjoy a shake in the morning, mix into a smoothie or stir into porridge. Suitable any time of day to increase your protein intake, particularly as part of a healthy lifestyle.
