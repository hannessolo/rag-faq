We believe in taking care on the inside. And our Marine Collagen & Vitamin C has been expertly formulated with the very best ingredients to do just that. We know you’d expect nothing less. Each serving packs in 14g type 1 collagen protein and 24mg of vitamin C. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body. It’s everywhere. In the bones, skin, gums, blood vessels, teeth and cartilage. Your natural production can slow down with age, so a supplement can be a good idea. Vitamin C contributes towards normal collagen formation, skin and cartilage function*. Uniting the two into a convenient, single supplement seemed like a winning combination. And with 14g protein and zero sugar per serving, it’s also a great step towards reaching your daily protein goals. Our marine collagen is made from fish skin. Agreed, that doesn’t sound very appealing. But fear not, it doesn’t actually taste like fish. Sourced in the EU, it has been hydrolysed to ensure maximum absorption into the body and has a neutral flavour. Yes, neutral. Choose Unflavoured, and it mixes in with pretty much anything. Your morning coffee, afternoon smoothie or post-workout protein shake.
