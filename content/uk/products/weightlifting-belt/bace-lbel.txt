FAQs

### FAQs

### What does a belt do for lifting?

Weightlifting belts help increase intra-abdominal pressure, providing your core muscles with a stable base to push against during heavy lifts. This extra stability allows most lifters to lift more weight with a belt than without.

### Do you really need a lifting belt?

A weightlifting belt can be beneficial if you regularly perform deadlifts and squats at or above your bodyweight, or need additional support for your lower back during heavy barbell exercises.

### When should I get a lifting belt?

It's generally recommended to consider using a lifting belt when performing deadlifts and squats at or above your bodyweight. It's important to note that a beginner weightlifter should properly learn to use their core and midline before relying on a weightlifting belt.

### Is it OK to wear a lifting belt all the time?

Ideally, your warm up sets should be beltless, and then working sets belted. You can loosen the belt in between sets. It's recommended to wear a belt when you are lifting particularly heavy, so this may not always be the case in every session.
