### Diet Protein Shake

Diet Protein Shake contains less than 4g of carbohydrate per serving with all the protein, as well as added glucomannan contributing to weight loss.\*

Our Diet Protein Shake takes the best aspects of our original formula and pushes them even further. It combines a range of protein sources plus added nutritional supplements to create a protein formula for anyone on an energy restricted diet.

The protein in Diet Protein Shake is a blend of whey protein and milk protein concentrate, providing a combination of fast and slow release proteins. We’ve halved the carb content of our original Diet Protein Shake™ formula, and added glucomannan, a popular diet ingredient that contributes to weight loss.\*

**Glucomannan:**

Derived from the konjac plant, glucomannan contributes to weight loss in the context of an energy restricted diet.

**Green Tea Extract:**

Green tea has been popular in China for centuries and is a popular supplement in its own right, making a unique addition to this formula.

**Clarinol® CLA:**

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a form of omega-6 essential fat. Clarinol® is the most premium source of CLA available, with unmatched purity and quality.

**Glutamine Peptides:**

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle.

**Acetyl L-Carnitine:** Diet Protein Shake contains an incredible 750mg of acetyl l-carnitine per serving.

\\

### Purpose

We designed our Diet Protein Shake for trainers looking to stimulate weight loss\* while maintaining muscle mass as part of a healthy diet and active lifestyle. Use Diet Protein Shake to ensure you’re maintaining your vital protein intake as part of an energy restricted diet.
