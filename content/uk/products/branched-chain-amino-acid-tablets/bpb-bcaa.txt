### Branched Chain Amino Acids

An easy way to up your intake of BCAAs, these tablets provide 1000mg of BCAAs in a single serving, delivering leucine, isoleucine and valine in an impressive 2:1:1 ratio.

BCAAs are a specific form of essential amino acid that comprise about ⅓ of the protein in our muscles, and can only be obtained from the diet. Our Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) Tablets provide you with the 3 essential BCAAs in a simple, convenient form.

Each serving of our Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) Tablets provides you with 1000mg of leucine, isoleucine and valine in a 2:1:1 ratio, so you always have quick, easy access to high quality BCAAs to support your training journey.

\\

### Purpose

Our Branched Chain Amino Acid (BCAA) Tablets are designed for anyone looking to maintain their BCAA intake on a daily basis. They’re ideal for trainers on a vegan or vegetarian diet as some BCAAs are difficult to obtain from non-animal food products.
