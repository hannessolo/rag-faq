### Co Enzyme Q10 (CoQ10)

Co Enzyme Q10, commonly referred to as CoQ10, is found in almost every cell in the body. It’s commonly found in foods like meat and fish, but in relatively low amounts. This CoQ10 powder is ideal for supplementing your CoQ10 intake with minimal hassle.

The “Co” in CoQ10 is an abbreviation of cofactor, describing the role the nutrient plays as a cofactor in the function of particular enzymes in the body. It can be synthesised in the liver from l-tyrosine, but typically in small amounts which tend to decrease with age. Supplementing CoQ10 can ensure your body is always receiving an essential dose to keep you fully functioning.
