### Gluten Free Ultra Fine Oats

A premium source of high-quality, gluten-free, slow-release carbohydrates. Ideal for adding to shakes for an extra hit of energy without the unnecessary sugar.

Oats are probably best known as a breakfast food, but they’re great for sports nutrition. High in complex carbohydrates and low in sugar, they’re an ideal ingredient for protein shakes and weight gain programmes. Our gluten-free option is ideal for coeliacs and anyone with a gluten intolerance.

Our Gluten Free Ultra Fine Oats have been ground down to an ultra fine powder, making them easy to add to your favourite protein shakes, smoothies, and even baking recipes. Ultra Fine Gluten Free Oats provide 4g beta-glucans per 100g and 2g per 50g serving, which contribute to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol levels. (The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 3g of beta-glucans from oats, oat bran, barley, barley bran or from mixtures of these beta-glucans.)

\\

### Purpose

Our Gluten Free Ultra Fine Oats are adaptable, versatile and easy to mix, so they’re perfect for integrating into your regular nutritional regime. They’re especially good for athletes on a weight gain programme who need extra calories to pile on the muscle.
