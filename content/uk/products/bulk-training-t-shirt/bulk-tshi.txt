### Training T-Shirt

Form, fit and function combine to make this t-shirt your ideal training partner.

Made from a cotton and elastane blend, the Training T-Shirt from **Bulk™** is comfortable, breathable and allows unrestricted movement.

This Training T-Shirt has been designed to hug the chest, shoulders and arms – accentuating these key body parts – whilst adopting a more relaxed fit around the torso.

Contrast **Bulk™** branding features to the chest and back, whilst a curved hem serves to flatter the wearer.

As part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability, not only is this product manufactured in Europe to substantially reduce carbon emissions, but it is supplied without a hang tag and in a compostable outer bag.

All our clothing is unisex.
