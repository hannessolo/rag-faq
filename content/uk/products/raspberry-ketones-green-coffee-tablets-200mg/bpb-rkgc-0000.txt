### Raspberry Ketones & Green Coffee Tablets 200mg

Two popular nutritional supplements in a single convenient tablet, providing 100mg of raspberry ketones and 100mg of green coffee extract in a single supplement.

Raspberry ketones & green coffee extract are two nutritional ingredients that have gained increasing attention in the sports nutrition and supplement market in recent years.

Ketones are a chemical that your body uses to turn fat into energy, particularly when it doesn’t have ready access to sugars. As the name suggests, Raspberry ketones are found in raspberries, but can also be found in cranberries, rhubarb roots and pine needles. Our raspberry ketones extract is EU compliant, produced at an appropriate 4:1 ratio water/ethanol extraction. Green coffee extract is extracted from unroasted coffee beans, containing a market-leading 50% chlorogenic acid content.

\\
