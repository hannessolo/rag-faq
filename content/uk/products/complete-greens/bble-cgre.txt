### Complete Greens™

Bulk™ Complete Greens™ have been a staple of our product range since 2012. Over the course of the years, there’s been a few variations of this product, some with more ingredients and some with less. We’ve always done our best to bring the best product to our customers, which is why we now have the ethos of “less is more”. We’ve chopped the ingredients list down from 25 ingredients to 8 of the best super greens that are fully established in sports nutrition.

Our super greens powder now consist of Spirulina, Chlorella, Broccoli, Pumpkin Protein, Spinach, Alfalfa, Moringa and Kale. In the unflavoured version, these eight ingredients are all you’ll get, in all their vibrant green glory. In our flavoured versions, we add some natural flavouring, citric acid and stevia extract to provide a fruity twist to the experience

Complete Greens™ are high in fibre and low in saturated fat. We believe that the reformulation of this product is now giving our customers more of what they want and less of what they don’t, all packed into one convenient vegetable supplement.

Complete Greens™ are perfect for adding to smoothies, soups, or just for shaking up with some water for a hit of fibre.
