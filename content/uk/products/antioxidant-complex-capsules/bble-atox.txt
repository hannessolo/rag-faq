### Antioxidant Complex Capsules

You’ve probably heard that antioxidants are beneficial for fighting oxidative stress\*. But what does that actually mean? There are a few layers to unpack. Here’s the simplified version.

Every time we inhale oxygen, it goes through a process called oxidation. Free radicals are produced as a result, which our bodies need in small doses. Antioxidants are created to keep them in line. Oxidative stress is when our ability to neutralise the free radicals with antioxidants becomes imbalanced. Essentially, the free radicals have gone rogue and our system struggles to cope.

With that in mind, our Antioxidant Complex Capsules have been expertly formulated with one goal - to provide a comprehensive blend of 20 vitamins, minerals, plant extracts and amino acids, designed to give the cells of your body the best possible opportunity to protect against oxidative stress\*. See them as little suits of armour for your cells.

Sounds great. But what’s inside? In addition to the vitamins and minerals above, these potently dosed capsules are loaded with a synergistic blend of vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, manganese, selenium, copper and riboflavin. They all work as a team to fight back against pro-oxidative compounds. All of which contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.

3 capsules includes 500mg N-acetyl L-cysteine, 200mg turmeric extract and 200mg grape seed extract, along with 100mg each of olive leaf extract, L-glutathione and green tea extract.

Take a breath, as we haven’t quite finished. The formula has been topped off with 50mg trans-resveratrol and broccoli extract, 25mg quercetin and CoEnzyme Q10, 5mg of BioPerine, 2.5mg of lycopene and 1mg astaxanthin. And relax.

\* Zinc contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.
