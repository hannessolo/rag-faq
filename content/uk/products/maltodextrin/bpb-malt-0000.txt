### Maltodextrin

100% pure maltodextrin with no additives or fillers. Contains 95g of carbohydrates per 100g – a perfect ingredient for DIY weight gain formulas.

Maltodextrin is a carbohydrate source commonly used in weight gain shake formulas. Our Maltodextrin is high quality, with no unnecessary additives or fillers, so you can mix it with your favourite shake to add some extra carbs, or use it as part of your own DIY formula.

Maltodextrin is a form of sugar manufactured from starch called a polysaccharide. It gets its name due to its formation from dextrose polymers of different lengths. Unlike dextrose, it doesn’t taste sweet. It’s a great carbohydrate to combine with whey protein, creatine and amino acids.
