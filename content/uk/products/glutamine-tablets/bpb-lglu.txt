### Glutamine Tablets

When it comes to amino acids found in muscle tissue, glutamine sits at the top. As the leader of the pack, it dominates all others. We’re not ones to pick favourites. But naturally, this supplement is a popular choice with serious weight trainers and bodybuilders.

Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid. This means your body can produce it, but it may need to be supplemented through diet when under pressure. Working your muscles during intense training can significantly deplete your supply. So if you’re hitting the gym hard, these small but mighty tablets could be just the support you need.

High quality and ultra pure (as you’d expect), our Glutamine Tablets allow you to conveniently top up when you need it most. Each tablet packs in 1000mg glutamine. Reach your daily dose in no time. It’s that simple.

\\

### Purpose

If you’re putting your body through its paces, our Glutamine Tablets are a convenient way to ensure optimum glutamine levels during the most vital periods. An easy on-the-go supplement to support your healthy diet.
