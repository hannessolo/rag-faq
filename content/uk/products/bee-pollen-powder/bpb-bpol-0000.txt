### Bee Pollen Powder

High quality, ethically-sourced bee pollen powder for use as an alternative protein source, with 18g of protein per 100g. Perfect for adding to foods and drinks, as well as mixing into smoothies and shakes.

Pollen is a very fine powder produced in the stamen (male part) of flowers. In recent years, it’s increased in popularity as a nutrient rich superfood. Our ethically-sourced Bee Pollen Powder is responsibly collected using only fallen pollen from inside beehives, so their routine is undisturbed, and you get the most nutritious bee pollen powder possible.

Bee pollen powder is a great vegetarian protein source, providing 18g of protein per 100g. It’s also high in fibre, and blends well into foods, drinks, smoothies and shakes, making it an ideal all-rounder nutritional supplement for anyone on a vegetarian or meat-free diet.

\\

### Purpose

Bee Pollen Powder is a great superfood supplement for anyone who wants to add a new variety of nutrition into their diet. Add it to your regular protein shake formula for some added protein and fibre, or mix it in with your favourite recipes. Regarding vegan diets, bee pollen powder is collected by bees, but is technically not an animal by product, so it is a personal decision as to whether bee pollen is suitable for a vegan diet but is vegetarian friendly.
