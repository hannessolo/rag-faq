### Inulin

100% pure inulin powder sourced from chicory roots, a premium soluble fibre that provides over 85g of fibre per 100g, as well as serving a range of uses in cooking and baking.

Inulin is a dietary fibre sourced from filtered and purified chicory roots. It’s a non-digestible fibre, meaning it passes through the stomach and small intestine unchanged, aiding the passage of other foods through your body. It also has a number of culinary uses, and can even be added to smoothies or shakes to thicken them and add sweetness.

Inulin belongs to a class of dietary fibres called fructans and is part of a larger group of naturally occurring polysaccharides. It’s found in a number of foods, including many pulses and vegetables. In cooking, it can be used to preserve moisture in cakes and biscuits, and is also used as a binding agent. It has a neutral taste with a subtle sweetness, meaning you can even use it as a mild sweetener in smoothies.
