Description

### MCT Oil

Premium MCT oil sourced 100% from coconuts. A great source of easy digesting fats in a form you can pour over salads, mix into recipes, blend into smoothies, or even eat right off the spoon.

Medium chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are a form of highly digestible fat sourced from coconuts. Our MCT Oil is a great ingredient for endurance athletes creating their own DIY nutritional formulas, or anyone who wants to add extra fat into their diet with minimal hassle.

Medium chain triglycerides are easier for the body to digest because, as the name suggests, they’re smaller than long chain triglycerides, such as those found in olive oil. This makes them a great fat source for athletes who require a fat source that can be quickly processed and absorbed by the body. Our MCT Oil contains 60% C8 and 40% C10, two fatty acids that are particularly popular for people following a ketogenic diet.

\\

### Purpose

Our MCT Oil is ideal for use as an ingredient in DIY post-training formulas, particularly for endurance athletes such as long-distance runners, cyclists and triathletes who need highly digestible fats as part of their nutritional intake.
