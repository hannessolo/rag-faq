### Glucomannan Powder

100% pure glucomannan powder, a water soluble fibre which can contribute to weight loss\* in the context of an energy restricted diet.

A common ingredient in slim pasta and rice formulas, glucomannan is a water soluble fibre sourced from the Amorphophallus Konjac plant. This glucomannan powder allows you to supplement glucomannan before mealtimes as part of your energy restricted diet.

Glucomannan has been shown to contribute to weight loss\* in the context of an energy restricted diet. The beneficial effect is gained by taking 1g of glucomannan before each meal with plenty of water.

\\

### Purpose

Our Glucomannan (Konjac) Powder is suitable for anyone following a calorie controlled diet who is aiming to lose weight. Each dose should be taken with plenty of water, to ensure it reaches the stomach. This product is not suitable for people who have swallowing difficulties, as the fibre expands.

\*Glucomannan contributes to weight loss in the context of an energy restricted diet. The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 3g of glucomannan in 3 doses of 1g each, taken with 1-2 glasses of water before meals and in the context of an energy restricted diet.
