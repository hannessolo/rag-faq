### 5-HTP Capsules 100mg

A potent 100mg dose of 5-HTP, a direct precursor to serotonin and melatonin, at double the strength of the majority of competing supplements.

5-hydroxytryptophan, or 5-HTP for short, is a compound that your body makes from the essential amino acid tryptophan, and is a precursor for the body’s production of serotonin and melatonin. Though tryptophan is typically obtained from foods like meat, fish and dairy, there are no dietary sources of 5-HTP, and some people choose to take it as a supplement.

Our supplemental 5-HTP Capsules use 5-HTP sources from the seeds of the Griffonia simplicifolia shrub, providing a potent 100mg dose in a single capsule. It’s usually taken before bed.

\\

### Purpose

Please note: This supplement is not suitable for anyone taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other medication intended for treatment of depression. Consult with your doctor or medical professional if you have any doubts.
