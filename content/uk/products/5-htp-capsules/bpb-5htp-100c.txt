### 5-HTP Capsules 100mg

A potent 100mg dose of 5-HTP, a direct precursor to serotonin and melatonin, at double the strength of the majority of competing supplements.

5-hydroxytryptophan, or 5-HTP for short, is a compound that your body makes from the essential amino acid tryptophan, and is a precursor for the body’s production of serotonin and melatonin. Though tryptophan is typically obtained from foods like meat, fish and dairy, there are no dietary sources of 5-HTP, and some people choose to take it as a supplement.

Our supplemental 5-HTP Capsules use 5-HTP sources from the seeds of the Griffonia simplicifolia shrub, providing a potent 100mg dose in a single capsule. It’s usually taken before bed.

\\

### Purpose
