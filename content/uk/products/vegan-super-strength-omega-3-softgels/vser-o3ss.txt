### Vegan Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels

When it comes to getting your necessary omega 3s, the mind tends to drift towards fish oils, specifically the essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA). For decades, fish oil has been the primary source of these healthy fatty acids. However, in recent years, the algae industry has caught up. It makes sense to get omega 3s from algae, being the primary source of nutrients in the marine food chain. By choosing an algae supplement, you’ll be cutting out the middleman (or middle fish in this case).

Vegan Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels are made with a blend of algae oils to provide a high dose of essential fatty acids. Each daily serving of two softgels provides 384mg DHA and 128mg EPA; enough to contribute towards a healthy brain, a healthy heart and healthy eyes\*\*\*. This is a plant-based supplement that’s worth adding to your regime, no matter your choice of diet.

Vegan Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels are incredibly convenient to use. Just take 2 capsules daily, preferably with food. They can also be combined with other health & wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs. Vegan Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels are supplied in fully recyclable aluminium packaging. They are also encased in a completely vegan softgel shell, made from a blend of corn starch and seaweed. This is a plant-based alternative to the traditional bovine gelatine shell that most omega 3 supplements use, giving you a high-strength, completely animal-free supplement.

\*EPA and DHA contribute to the normal function of the heart. The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 250 mg of EPA and DHA.

\*\*DHA contributes to maintenance of normal brain function. The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 250 mg of DHA.

\*\*\*DHA contributes to the maintenance of normal vision. The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 250 mg of DHA.
