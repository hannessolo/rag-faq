### Informed Mass Gainer - Rocky Road 3kg

The very best mass gain supplement from **Bulk™**  designed for professional athletes and serious trainers, using premium protein and carbohydrate sources as well as proprietary ingredients like DigeZyme® and LactoSpore®. Every ingredient is listed in detail, lab tested and elite athlete approved. If you don’t love it, we’ll give you your money back\*.

We set out to make the best mass gain supplement money can buy. So we did. Informed Mass&REG; contains everything you need to bulk up, build muscle and put on weight, using the very best ingredients money can buy. Accept no alternatives.

When creating Informed Mass®, we took zero shortcuts. We chose the best ingredients on the market at every single step, supplementing your essential protein and carb intake with digestive enzymes, probiotics and amino acids to provide a serious mass gain supplement with a complete nutritional profile.

*   **mTOR Protein Complex™:** Informed MassS® contains 45g of protein in a single 150g serving using our exclusive mTOR’s protein complex. Unlike most other formulas, mTOR Protein Complex™ uses premium whey protein isolate as its primary protein source (65%) with whey protein concentrate as a secondary source (35%).
*   **Ultra Fine Scottish Oats:** Slow releasing and low in sugar, oats are considered one of the best carbohydrate sources available for mass gain programmes.
*   ****\*Creatine Monohydrate:**** Creatine monohydrate is the most researched and effective performance supplement on the market today, and has been shown to increase physical performance in successive bursts of short term, high intensity exercise. (The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 3 g of creatine.)
*   **HMB:** HMB is a metabolite of the L-leucine amino acid that’s been researched by sports scientists for over two decades. Informed Mass® offers 1.5g of HMB per serving.
*   **Glutamine Peptides:** Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle, and our Informed Mass® formula contains 3g of glutamine peptides per serving.
*   **Flaxseed Powder:** Added to provide extra fat and fibre.
*   **Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs):** Added as a source of Fats.
*   **DigeZyme® Digestive Enzymes:** Digestive Enzymes help to break down protein, carbohydrate, cellulose and fat. DigeZyme® is a popular blend of five digestive enzymes: protease, amylase, lipase, lactase and cellulase.
*   **LactoSpore®:** LactoSpore®’s preparation is a high quality, superior source of Bacillus coagulans.
