### L Lysine

100% pure l-lysine amino acid in a convenient powder form, ideal for adding to protein shakes and pre-workout formulas.

L-lysine is an essential amino acid, which means it cannot be synthesised by the body, and must be obtained from your diet. It’s typically found in foods such as meat, legumes and dairy products, but some trainers choose to supplement it to ensure they’re getting a regular supply.

Our l-lysine powder contains nothing but pure l-lysine at an ultra low price, providing an excellent source of essential amino acid that you can mix with your favourite workout formulas, or even add to your own personal DIY blends.

\\

### Purpose

Our l-lysine powder is suitable for anyone looking to up their regular intake of l-lysine amino acid. It’s especially good for adding to pre-workout shakes or, if you’re an experienced trainer, you can use it as part of your personal DIY formulas.

\\

### Benefits

*   Pure Potency

Contains 100% high quality l-lysine.

*   Made for Mixing

Perfect for mixing with your favourite shakes and smoothies.
