### Mushroom Complex Capsules

Mushrooms pop up in all sorts of places. They grow out of the ground, off trees or on rotting wood. And who spotted the unusual appearance of a lion’s mane mushroom (if you haven’t seen one, the clue is in the name) and decided this would be a great thing to eat? We’re thankful they did. Our Mushroom Complex Capsules combine seven powerful mushroom extracts, all of which have traditional use, along with some vegan-friendly vitamin D3.

Let’s take a closer look at what’s inside. Each capsule packs in mushroom extracts of Cordyceps sinensis, lion’s mane, reishi, chaga, shiitake, maitake and oyster. You’ll find 500mg mushroom extract in total, divided into 71.5mg of each. Each extract is standardised to provide 30% polysaccharides and is 15:1 in strength, so the actual mushroom equivalent is 7.5g per capsule. These mighty mushroom capsules really are in a league of their own.

We’ve added 10 micrograms of vegan-friendly vitamin D3 to contribute to normal immune function\*. 1-3 capsules a day is all it takes to benefit from some marvellous mushroom goodness.

Our Mushroom Complex Capsules can be combined with some of our other health and wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs. Suitable to take alongside KSM-66® Ashwagandha Capsules, Brain Health Capsules, Daily Nootropic Capsules or Complete Zen™.

_\*Vitamin D contributes to the normal function of the immune system._
