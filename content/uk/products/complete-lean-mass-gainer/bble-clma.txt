### Lean Mass Gainer

A more measured way to load up throughout the day. This precise mass gain formula is for trainers who want to build muscle mass\* in a controlled manner. Each 85g serving contains 314kcal, comprising of 37g protein, at least 32g carbohydrate and under 5g fat.

If you want to bulk up, you’ve got to pack in the calories, but some people might want to take a more steady approach.The ingredients in Lean Mass Gainer are carefully sourced to provide the nutrition you need in careful measure.

The protein is sourced from a combination of whey protein concentrate and milk protein concentrate, meaning you get a mix of fast and slow release proteins, and the carbohydrates come from ultra fine oats. On top of that, we’ve even added glutamine. \*Protein contributes to a growth in muscle mass.

\\

### Purpose

We designed our Lean Mass Gainer for trainers who want to increase their muscle mass without necessarily piling in the carbs. Each serving’s 328 kcal calorie content places it perfectly between a typical protein shake and traditional mass gainers, which usually contain over 500 kcals per serving. If you think you need a more serious mass gain powder, check out our Mass Gainer formula.
