### 1™ Complete Food Shake

When you’re short of time, the right nutrition can take second place. That’s why we created **1™ Complete Food Shake**. A complete meal that balances all the goodness you need in one shake. Choose your flavour, shake and sip your way to satisfaction.

Packed with protein, high in fibre and low in sugar. The vegan-friendly ingredients list is off the scale. A rainbow of wholefoods including sweet potato, avocado, coconut, pumpkin seeds and peas. We’ve also added essential vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes and live cultures to rack up your nutritional intake. You won’t find a more convenient complete meal that overperforms on taste, texture and time.

Each serving packs in 30g protein, 37g carbs, 12g fat and 9.6g fibre. You’ll also benefit from at least 30% of your daily recommended intake of 24 vitamins and minerals. If that’s not enough, we’ve added Lutein, Zeaxanthin and Meso-Zeaxanthin from Lutemax 2020, Ashwagandha from KSM-66, Digestive Enzymes from DigeZyme and live cultures from LactoSpore. All your macronutrients right here. So, what are you waiting for?

What’s in the pouch?

**Sweet Potato** for slow-releasing carbohydrates to balance your macros.

**Coconut** for easily-absorbed MCT oil.

**Avocado** is a great source of monounsaturated fats (the good ones).

**Pumpkin Seeds** for a potent portion of protein.
