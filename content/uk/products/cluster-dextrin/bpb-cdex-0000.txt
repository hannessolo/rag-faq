### Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin

A cutting edge performance carbohydrate taking the sports nutrition world by storm. Provides 25g of gradual release, premium carbohydrate in a single 25g serving, maintaining energy levels throughout your workout.

This 100% pure Cluster Dextrin® formula is perfect for mixing into your regular pre-workout shake to provide a vital, gradual release energy source.

Cyclic dextrin is produced using a unique enzyme process which breaks down starches into a unique cluster structure. Essentially, this creates a superior carbohydrate that is both easier for your body to absorb while maintaining the gradual release of starch. The result is a carbohydrate that helps you to train harder and longer, and recover faster.
