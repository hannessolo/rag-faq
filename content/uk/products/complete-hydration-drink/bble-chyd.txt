### Hydration Drink

Our high-performance isotonic formula, containing a tri-carbohydrate blend of maltodextrin, dextrose and fructose, as well as instant BCAAs, vitamin B6 and a blend of 4 electrolytes, all dosed at optimal levels.

Our Hydration Drink™ is what it sounds like: A high-performance drink formula that provides you with a rich blend of fast release carbohydrates, Instant BCAAs, vitamin B6 and electrolytes to give you a boost when you need it most. It’s carefully balanced to provide optimum nutrition for endurance athletes and prolonged exercise, and because it’s in a formula, you can mix it to your personal requirements, whether hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic.

We use a tri-carbohydrate blend in our Hydration Drink™, as multiple carbohydrate sources can result in superior uptake. Specifically, Hydration Drink™ uses a balance of maltodextrin, dextrose and fructose. We’ve also added instant BCAAs, as well as 4 key electrolytes (sodium, magnesium, potassium and calcium) to replenish your nutrients when they’re most depleted. As a final touch, we’ve added a dose of vitamin B6, helping to reduce tiredness and fatigue, and assist with conversion of food to energy.

\\

### Purpose

Our Hydration Drink™ is similar to many of the well-known isotonic drinks you find on the high street, but with a more precise formula, superior ingredients, and in a form that you can adapt to your specific nutritional needs – and at a fraction of the price. It’s an ideal energy source for every athlete, especially endurance athletes such as long distance runners, triathletes and cyclists.
