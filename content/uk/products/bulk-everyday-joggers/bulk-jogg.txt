### Everyday™ Joggers

Make every day a leg day with these Everyday™ Joggers.

Exclusively from **Bulk™**, Everyday™ Joggers are the perfect lower body companion – whatever your day has in store.

Everyday™ Joggers are made from a premium blend of cotton and polyester, complemented by a soft-brushed inner fleece for an added touch of luxury. All that whilst still having enough stretch to accommodate even the heaviest of leg days.

Everyday™ Joggers are slim fitting with tapered bottoms that hug the ankle. If you prefer a more relaxed fit, then we suggest opting for a size larger than you’d usually wear.

The **Bulk™** logo features to the left hand side, just underneath the pocket, and ensures that everyone knows you’re representing #teambulk.

As part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability, not only is this product manufactured in Europe to substantially reduce carbon emissions, but it is supplied without a hang tag and in a compostable outer bag.

All our clothing is unisex.

*   65% cotton / 35% polyester blend
