### FAQs

### What does maca powder do for you?

Maca is claimed to be an adaptogenic plant, helping the body cope better with the physical effects of stress. However, the scientific evidence supporting these broader claims is still inconclusive, but nonetheless, adding maca powder into a well-balanced diet is a great means of incorporating some all-important nutrients.

### How do you use it?

Maca powder can be easily incorporated into your daily routine. It can be added to smoothies, porridge, yoghurt, or used as an ingredient in baking recipes. Simply mix 1 scoop (15g) into your preferred meal, shake, or snack.

### Does maca increase estrogen?

The exact mechanisms of how maca works are still not fully understood. However, it is important to note that maca does not contain estrogen and its potential effects are not believed to be mediated by altering hormone levels.

### Is it ok to use maca everyday?

Using maca powder daily is generally considered safe for most individuals. However, as for any new food or supplements, it's recommended to start with a lower dosage and gradually increase it while monitoring how your body responds.

### What does maca powder taste like?

Maca powder has a flavour that is often described as nutty and slightly sweet. Though, taste preferences vary, so it's best to try it for yourself and see how you enjoy it.
