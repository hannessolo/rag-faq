### Cutting Edge™

The very best weight loss\* supplement from **Bulk**™ using 10 popular ingredients combined into a single, pioneering formula.

Cutting Edge™ is our pinnacle weight loss product, produced to the same standard as all of our **Bulk**™ PRO products. That means total transparency, with every single ingredient listed, as well as exact quantities. We’ve combined 10 ingredients into a single formula, creating a supplement that can contribute to weight loss\*, thyroid function, lipid metabolism and blood sugar level regulation.

Each ingredient in our Cutting Edge™ weight loss\* supplement is dosed to optimal levels in its most bioavailable form, meaning your body will readily absorb it quicker than regular formulas. And unlike other products, we don’t hide our formula behind proprietary blends. We lay out each ingredient, its quantity, and what it does.

*   **Glucomannan:** Derived from the konjac plant, glucomannan contributes to weight loss in the context of an energy restricted diet\*.
*   **L-Phenylalanine:** Commonly found in protein-rich foods, l-phenylalanine is a precursor to the amino acid Tyrosine.
*   **Caffeine:** Caffeine is best known as a stimulant, but it has also been shown to reduce your RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion, or, how hard you think you’re training), so you can train harder for longer.
*   **Cinnamon Extract:** Cinnamon is a spice that has been used in food for thousands of years.
*   **Peppermint Leaf Powder:** Mint is widely known as an ancient herb. It’s been a popular herb with multiple uses for centuries, owing to its characteristic scent and flavour.
*   **Choline Bitartrate:** Part of the B-complex family of vitamins, choline is an essential nutrient commonly found in foods such as spinach and egg yolks. Choline is a precursor to phospholipids, which contribute to normal fat metabolism in the body.
*   **BioPerine®:** BioPerine® is a natural thermonutrient that’s extracted from the Piper nigrum L plant (black pepper). **Chromium Picolinate:** Chromium contributes to normal macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of normal blood glucose levels.
*   **Selenium Methionine:** An extremely fast-absorbing form of selenium, bound to the amino acid methionine, selenium has been shown to contribute to protection of cells from oxidative stress and normal thyroid function.

**\*\*Cutting Edge™ | Money Back Guarantee** We’re confident that you’ll love our PRO range. If for any reason you’re not happy with your purchase, however, and have not used an unreasonable amount, simply return it to our specified returns address within 28 days of purchase and we’ll credit your customer account with Bulk™ credit to the value of the returned product.
