### Complete Anti-E™

The ideal supplement for PCT programmes, using potent ingredients including resveratrol, BioPerine&REG; and indole-3-carbinol in research-proven doses.

Our Anti-E Formula supplement has been expertly formulated to support you during your PCT programme, providing a considered selection of potent ingredients commonly found in male support formulas, in carefully measured doses.

Our Anti-E Formula is fully transparent, meaning we list every ingredient and their precise dosage measures, so you know exactly what you’re putting in your body. We used only the most potent source of each ingredient and research-proven dosages.

**Resveratrol**

Resveratrol is a plant compound that naturally occurs in foods like red grapes and red wine, as well as the Japanese Knotweed root. We’ve sourced the highest purity resveratrol available for this supplement, so you can get a full dose in a single, simple serving.

**Indole-3-Carbinol**

Found in high levels in vegetables like broccoli, cabbage and sprouts, indole-3-carbinol is a common ingredient in a whole range of male support formulas. Few pack the dose of Complete Anti-E™ however, which provides an impressive 400mg dosage in each serving.

**Bladderwrack Extract**

A seaweed commonly found on the coasts of the North Sea and Baltic Sea.

**BioPerine®**

BioPerine® is a natural thermonutrient that’s extracted from the Piper nigrum L plant (black pepper). We added 5mg to each serving to increase the absorption rate of all other ingredients.

**Vitamin D3**

One of your body’s most essential nutrients, contributing to normal bones, immune system function and muscle function.
