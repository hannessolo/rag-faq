Description

### Krill Oil Softgels

A potent source of omega 3 essential fatty acids, these are essential because your body can’t produce them on its own – you have to obtain them from your diet or nutritional supplements.

Our Krill Oil is extracted from Euphausia Superba krill, which live deep in the Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. They’re rich in the Omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and free from contaminants such as heavy metals or pesticides.

\\

### Purpose

Our Krill Oil Softgels 500mg are for anyone looking to supplement their regular diet with omega fatty acids. They’re especially good for people whose regular dietary intake limits their access to omega fatty acids. Take regularly as part of a healthy diet and active lifestyle to maintain your nutritional intake.
