### Marine Collagen & Vitamin C Capsules

Supporting your skin couldn’t be simpler. Our Marine Collagen & Vitamin C Capsules have been expertly formulated to help you take care from the inside. Each serving packs in 1,000mg type 1 marine collagen and 80mg vitamin C. Two capsules, once a day, and you’re good to go.

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body. It’s everywhere. In the bones, skin, gums, blood vessels, teeth and cartilage. Your natural production slows down with age, so a supplement can be a good idea. Vitamin C contributes towards normal collagen formation.\* Combine the two, and you’re onto a winner.

\\

### Purpose

If you’re looking for a convenient way to support your skin, our Marine Collagen & Vitamin C capsules are just for you. A serving of 2 capsules provides 1,000mg marine collagen and 100% of your daily recommended intake of vitamin C. Made from type 1 marine collagen, this is a great alternative to bovine collagen.
