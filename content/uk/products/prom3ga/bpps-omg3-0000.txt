Vitamin D3 3000IU Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin produced underneath the skin as a reaction to sunlight exposure. As a result, it can be difficult to produce enough vitamin D during the dark winter months. We’ve added a full 3000iu dose of vitamin D3 to Prom3ga™ to support bone health, muscle function and immune system function. Astaxanthin (AstaPure™) Astaxanthin is a carotenoid commonly found in aquatic animals like krill and salmon, providing them with their dark red pigment. The body cannot synthesise astaxanthin, meaning it can only be obtained through the diet. Each serving of Prom3ga™ provides 300µg of AstaPure™, a pure, high quality, natural form of astaxanthin. \ Purpose As part of our Bulk™ PRO series of supplements, Prom3ga™ is designed for professional athletes and serious trainers, particularly those who want to obtain optimum omega 3 fish oil and vitamin D as part of their nutritional intake.
