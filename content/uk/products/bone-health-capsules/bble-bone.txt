### Bone Health Capsules

The adult skeleton contains 206 bones, which are primarily composed of minerals and Type 1 collagen, which already sounds like a lot to look after. As the name suggests, Bone Health Capsules from Bulk™ provide a synergistic combination of 13 active ingredients, including vitamins, minerals and plant extracts.

Bone Health Capsules contain Calcium, Magnesium, Manganese, Zinc and Vitamin K2, in the form of Menaquinone-7, all of which contribute to the maintenance of normal bones\*. Each serving also provides 100% of your daily recommended intake of Vitamin C, which contributes to normal collagen formation, for the normal function of bones\*\*. Copper and Manganese have been included as they contribute to the normal formation and maintenance of connective tissue. Vitamin D contributes to normal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which is why it made sense to add 25μg Vegan Vitamin D3 to round-out the formula. Finally, we’ve added Turmeric Extract, Cissus Quadrangularis, Phytodroitin™ and Silica from Bamboo Extract. There’s a lot going on in your 3 daily capsules.

These Bone Health Capsules are suitable for vegetarians and vegans and they’re incredibly easy to use. Just take 3 capsules and you can get on with your day, safe in the knowledge that you’ve taken care of your bones. They can also be combined with other health & wellbeing supplements to suit your individual needs.
