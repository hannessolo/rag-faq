### Complete Nootropic™

The most powerful multi-ingredient nootropic formula on the market, combining 17 powerfully dosed active ingredients designed to improve alertness (4) & concentration (1), contribute to normal cognitive function (2) and contribute to normal mental performance (3).

Nootropics are a rising category of nutritional supplements designed to aid mental performance during intense periods. Our Nootropic Capsules combine 17 of the most popular ingredients into a single, powerful supplement to provide the very best nootropic blend possible in a convenient form.

The term Nootropic is derived from the ancient Greek words νόος (nóos) meaning "mind" and τροπή (tropḗ) meaning "a turning“. We carefully researched a range of popular nootropic ingredients to provide the best formula possible.

*   **Ginkgo Biloba**  
    Extracted from the leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, a natural source of flavone glycosides and terpene lactones, along with other active compounds. Each serving provides a standard 6000mg dose.
*   **N-Acetyl L-Carnitine**  
    A naturally occurring amino acid compound, able to effectively cross the blood brain barrier.
*   **N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine**  
    An acetylated form of the l-tyrosine amino acid in its most water soluble and bioavailable form. N-acetyl l-tyrosine is a specific form of tyrosine that can’t be obtained via the diet.
*   **Panax Ginseng**  
    Perhaps the best known and most well researched of the ginseng family of herbs, a popular supplement that’s taken all over the world.
*   **KSM-66® Ashwagandha**  
    KSM-66® is a branded, full-spectrum extract of the root of the ashwagandha plant, also known as Indian ginseng or Winter cherry. Ashwagandha has adaptogenic properties, credited with supporting mental and physical capacities in cases of fatigue (6).
*   **Cognizin®**  
    Cognizin® is a phospholipid compound that converts to both choline and cytidine on ingestion, the latter of which converts to uridine in the body.
*   **DMAE Bitartrate**  
    Dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) is involved in the biochemical pathway to form the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine.
*   **Caffeine**  
    Probably the best known and most widely consumed stimulant in the world, helping to improve concentration (1) and alertness (4) as well as aiding performance (7).
*   **L-Theanine**  
    L-theanine is naturally found in green tea, and is dosed at a 1:1 ratio with caffeine in our formula.
*   **Spanish Sage**  
    Also known as Salvia lavandulaefolia, Spanish sage is one of the more unique ingredients in this formula, helping to maintain working memory and brain performance (5), fitting in perfectly with our supplement.
*   **Phosphatidyl Serine**  
    A phospholipid and component of cell membranes.
*   **AstraGin®**  
    AstraGin® has gained increasing attention in nutritional circles in recent years. A blend of root extract from Astragalus membranaceus and Panax notoginseng plants, it’s commonly touted as an alternative to black pepper extract.
*   **Zinc**  
    We added a dose of zinc citrate to contribute to normal vision and cognitive function.
*   **Vitamin B3**  
    Also known as niacin, vitamin B3 contributes to normal cognitive function and energy-yielding metabolism.
*   **Vitamin B5**  
    Also known as pantothenic acid, vitamin B5 contributes to normal cognitive performance. Our Complete Nootropic provides 100% of your recommended intake in a regular serving.
*   **Vitamin B6**  
    Unlike most other supplements, we used the active form of vitamin B6, P-5-P (pyridoxal phosphate), this means it can be directly utilised by the body much quicker. Vitamin B6 contributes to a reduction in tiredness and fatigue.
*   **Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin)**  
    We rounded out our formula with a dose of vitamin B12 in its superior methylcobalamin format, providing 100% of your recommended daily intake to contribute to normal function of your nervous system and cognitive functions.
