Description

### HMB Powder

HMB is an abbreviation of Beta-Hydroxy Beta-Methylbutyrate – it’s easy to see why it gets abbreviated to HMB!

HMB is an active metabolite of the Branched Chain Amino Acid, Leucine. HMB has been sold since the 1990s and has gained in popularity ever since. HMB is a popular addition to ‘all in one’ formulas, typically taken post-training.

Despite being similar, HMB and Leucine are metabolised differently. HMB is produced by the liver enzyme Ketoisocaproate. Increasing Leucine consumption would only result in modest increases in HMB levels.

Bulk™ HMB powder is of the highest purity and is made from 100% HMB powder.

\\

### Purpose

HMB powder is a great addition to post workout shakes. It can be added to an ‘all in one’ formula with protein, carbohydrate, Creatine and Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA).
