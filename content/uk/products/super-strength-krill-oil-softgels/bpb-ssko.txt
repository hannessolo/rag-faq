### Super Strength Krill Oil Softgels

A potent source of omega 3 essential fatty acids, free from contaminants, and at an incredible price. These super strength softgels provide an incredible 318mg of omega 3 fatty acids in daily serving.

Omega 3 essential fatty acids are essential because your body can’t produce them on its own – you have to obtain them from your diet or nutritional supplements. These Super Strength Krill Oil Softgels use oil extracted from Antarctic krill.

Our krill oil is extracted from Euphausia Superba krill, which live deep in the Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. They’re rich in the omega 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and free from contaminants such as heavy metals or pesticides. That means you get high potency omega 3 fatty acids from a premium source. A 2 softgel serving on our Super Strength Krill Oil Softgels provides your body with 318mg of omega 3 fatty acids, containing 178mg of EPA and 82mg of DHA.

\\

### Purpose

Our Super Strength Krill Oil Softgels 590mg are for anyone looking to supplement their regular diet with omega fatty acids. They’re especially good for people whose regular dietary intake limits their access to omega fatty acids. Take regularly as part of a healthy diet and active lifestyle to maintain your nutritional intake.
