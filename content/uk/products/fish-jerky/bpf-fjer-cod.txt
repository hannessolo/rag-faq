### Fish Jerky

Premium fish jerky manufactured using only high quality freeze-dried cod, with 40g of protein per 50g bag.

Our high quality Fish Jerky is a delicious and convenient protein-packed snack. Each 50g bag is packed with 40g of protein, equivalent to 250g of cod. Produced in Iceland, the cod is caught using environmentally responsible methods and dried through gentle freeze-drying technology that maintains the taste and nutritional value of the fish without the use of any added preservatives, food enhancers or colours.

Our Fish Jerky is the perfect ready-to-eat high protein snack, and a great lower-fat and higher-protein alternative to beef jerky. With 40g protein in a single pack, our Fish Jerky is a winning solution for reaching your daily protein target while also satisfying your snack cravings. Our Fish Jerky is fully traceable, and is sourced from Gadus morhua, a species of cod that is not threatened or endangered.
