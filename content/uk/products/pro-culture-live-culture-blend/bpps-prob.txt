### PRO CULTURE™

The most advanced live culture supplement from **Bulk™**, providing an advanced blend of live cultures, spores and synergistic ingredients into a single, powerful capsule, including LactoSpore&REG;, MicrobiomeX&REG;, Synbalance Sport Max™ and inulin. Lab tested for banned substances and approved for athletes. If you don’t love it, we’ll give you your money back\*.

We designed Pro Culture™ to be the very best live culture daily supplement available. Using a blend of five highly dosed live cultures, it offers the most advanced blend of cultures and synergistic ingredients on the market today. And as with all of our **Bulk™**  PRO products, we’re completely transparent about every ingredient and the quantity used, so you know exactly what you’re putting in your body and why.

Pro Culture™ contains five strains of live bacterial cultures: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, and LactoSpore®’s proprietary Bacillus coagulans preparations. We’ve dosed them potently to provide 20 billion CFUs (colony forming units) per two capsule serving, 2.5 times stronger than other leading blends. On top of that, we blended them with a range of synergistic ingredients to provide optimal nutritional support.

*   ****Inulin:**** Part of a class of dietary fibres called fructans, inulin is part of a larger group of naturally occurring polysaccharides. It’s found in a number of foods, including many pulses and vegetables.
*   **MicrobiomeX®:** An innovative ingredient extracted from Citrus sinensis which is a natural source of flavanone glycosides. MicrobiomeX® is standardised to provide 80% hesperidin and 3.5% naringin, two compounds typically found in the peel of citrus fruits.
*   **Synbalance Sport Max™ Blend:** We combined four live strains of bacteria into a single blend to create Synbalance Sport Max™. Its 20 billion CFU dose of cultures provides a potent mix of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis.
*   **LactoSpore®:** A preparation of Bacillus coagulans, a probiotic bacteria found in your gut. We chose LactoSpore®’s preparation because it’s more stable than typical preparations, ensuring you get the best nutrition from a proven probiotic.
