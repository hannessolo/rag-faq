### Vitamin D3 Tablets

High strength vitamin D tablets, provided in a highly bioavailable form, providing 2000% of your recommended intake per tablet.

Our Vitamin D3 Tablets are a specific, high-strength form of vitamin D. Vitamin D promotes normal bone health and contributes to the maintenance of healthy immune function, as well as playing a role in cell division.

Our Vitamin D3 Tablets provide double the dosage of typical vitamin D tablets, and at a far lower price. Vitamin D is crucial for normal muscle function but is present in relatively few foods. This fat soluble vitamin is particularly popular during winter when exposure to natural sunlight is lower.

\\

### Purpose

Our Vitamin D3 Tablets are ideal for anyone looking to increase their dietary vitamin D intake. They’re great when exposure to sunlight is low, like in the darker winter months. If you’re looking for a vegan-friendly form of vitamin D, try our vitamin D2 1000 tablets.
