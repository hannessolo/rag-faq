### Purpose

Our Vegan All-in-One formula is naturally developed for active people with a plant-based diet produced with trainers on a plant-based diet in mind, but that doesn’t mean it’s strictly for vegans. If you are looking to incorporate more plants into your diet, without sacrificing your protein intake, this formula is ideal.

\*Carbohydrates contribute to the recovery of normal muscle function (contraction) after highly intensive and/or long-lasting physical exercise leading to muscle fatigue and the depletion of glycogen stores in skeletal muscle. Beneficial effect is obtained by consuming carbohydrates, from all sources, at a total intake of 4 g per kg body weight, at doses, within the first 4 hours and no later than 6 hours, following highly intensive and/or long-lasting physical exercise that leads to muscle fatigue and depletion of glycogen stores in skeletal muscle.

\*\*Protein contributes to a growth in muscle mass.

\*\*\*Creatine increases physical performance in successive bursts of short-term, high intensity exercise. (The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 3 g of creatine.)
