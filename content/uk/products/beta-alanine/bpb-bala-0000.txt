### Beta Alanine

100% pure beta alanine powder in a convenient, mixable form, key to production of carnosine in skeletal muscle and an ideal pre-workout ingredient.

Beta alanine is a naturally occurring, non-essential amino acid that’s a popular pre-workout supplement. This 100% pure beta alanine powder is ideal for mixing into your regular pre-workout formula for an extra boost of amino acids.

Beta alanine combines with histidine to produce carnosine, one of the most concentrated amino acids in muscle. It’s typically consumed with creatine, arginine and citrulline malate for the best effects. We offer it in this 100% pure formula so you can mix and blend to fit your requirements.

\\

### Purpose

Our beta alanine powder is best used as a pre-workout ingredient, whether mixed into your favourite formula or as part of your own personal blend. We recommend mixing it with creatine, arginine and citrulline malate for the best results.
