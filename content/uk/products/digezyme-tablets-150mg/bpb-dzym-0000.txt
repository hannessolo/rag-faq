### DigeZyme® Tablets

A comprehensive blend of 5 digestive enzymes to aid digestion of nutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, fat and fibre, providing an incredible 150mg of pure DigeZyme® in a single tablet.

Digestive enzymes help your body to break down and digest vital nutrients so you get the best nutrition possible. Our DigeZyme® tablets provide a convenient dose of DigeZyme®’s unique blend of 5 digestive enzymes to support your nutritional intake.

DigeZyme® is a proprietary blend of amylase, protease, cellulase and lipase, contributing to normal digestive function. DigeZyme® is formulated to be resistant to gastric juices, so your body can absorb optimal nutrition throughout the day.

**Protease**  Aids the digestion of protein, a staple of any active person’s diet whether they’re bulking or cutting. **Amylase**  Aids the digestion of carbohydrates, another essential nutrient category. **Lipase**  Aids the breakdown and digestion of fats by breaking larger molecules into smaller ones. **Lactase**  Provides a source of the enzyme used to break down lactose. **Cellulase**  A healthy diet should be rich in fruits and vegetables. Cellulase helps your body to break down plant fibres.
