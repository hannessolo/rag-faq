### Aftermath Post-Workout Recovery

The very best post-workout recovery\* supplement from Bulk™, packed with 40g of protein per serving, patented performance ingredients and a superior array of nutrients with total transparency. We’re so proud of it, if you don’t love it, we’ll give you your money back.\*\*

Aftermath™ is created in compliance with international competition standards for professional athletes and elite trainers. Each batch is independently lab-tested for banned substances and impurities, we also break down every single ingredient and its quantity for total transparency, so professional athletes know exactly what they’re putting in their bodies.

Using a precise blend of high-quality protein, amino acids, glutamine peptides, creatine monohydrate, HMB and rapid-digestion carbohydrates, many of them exclusive and proprietary formulas, we created the very best supplement for serious trainers:

*   \*\*\*\*mTOR Protein Complex™**:** Aftermath™ contains 40g per serving of exclusive protein complex which, unlike most other formulas, uses premium whey protein isolate as its primary protein source. _Protein contributes to the growth of muscle mass._
*   **Vitargo® carbohydrate:** Each serving contains 22g of Vitargo®’s world patented sports carbohydrate, included for its low molecular weight.
*   **Glutamine Peptides:** Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle, and our Aftermath™ formula contains 5g of glutamine peptides per serving.
*   **Creatine Monohydrate (Creapure®️):** Creatine monohydrate is the most researched and effective performance supplement on the market today. Creatine Monohydrate (Creapure®️) is a leading provider of creatine monohydrate, guaranteeing 99.5% purity.
*   **HMB**:  
    HMB is a metabolite of the L-Leucine amino acid that’s been researched by sports scientists for over two decades. Aftermath™ offers 1.5g of HMB per serving.

\*Carbohydrates contribute to the recovery of normal muscle function after highly intensive and/or long-lasting physical exercise leading to muscle fatigue and the depletion of glycogen stores in skeletal muscle. The beneficial effect is obtained with the consumption of carbohydrates, from all sources, at a total intake of 4 g per kg body weight, at doses, within the first 4 hours and no later than 6 hours, following highly intensive and/or long-lasting physical exercise leading to muscle fatigue and the depletion of glycogen stores in skeletal muscle.
