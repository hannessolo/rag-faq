Description

### Medium Chain Triglycerides

Premium MCT powder, providing an easily digestible source of fat in a convenient, mixable form.

Medium chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are a form of highly digestible fat commonly found in coconut oil. Our medium chain triglycerides powder is a great ingredient for endurance athletes creating their own DIY nutritional formulas.

Medium chain triglycerides are easier for the body to digest because, as the name suggests, they’re smaller than long chain triglycerides, such as those found in olive oil. This makes them a great option for athletes who require a fat source that can be quickly processed and absorbed by the body.

\\

### Purpose

Our Medium Chain Triglycerides comes in a convenient powder form, ideal for use as an ingredient in DIY post-training formulas, particularly for endurance athletes such as long-distance runners, cyclists and triathletes who need highly digestible fats as part of their nutritional intake.

\\

### Benefits

*   Do It Yourself

Use it to create your own personal workout supplement formula.

*   Made for Mixing
