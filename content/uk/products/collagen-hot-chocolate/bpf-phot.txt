### Collagen Hot Chocolate

Imagine the most comforting, cosy chocolate drink. Every sip is a step towards your protein goals. Seriously? Absolutely. Introducing our Collagen Hot Chocolate. Created to give you pleasure and power in one. Smooth, velvety chocolate and a punchy 20g protein per cup. This really is next-level nutrition.

Because we don’t do things by halves, we’ve carefully selected the collagen proteins to create a protein-packed hot chocolate with no compromise on flavour. We’ve used hydrolysed collagen peptides, composed of types 1 and 3 collagen, which have a neutral flavour and blend well at both high and low temperatures. A touch of cocoa powder and some MCTs (medium chain triglycerides) give it a rich, creamy texture.

Start your day with a little luxury, take some time out post-workout or wind down with a warming bedtime drink. There’s always a time and a place for this one.

\\

### Purpose

If you’re looking for a rich hot chocolate and a healthy hit of protein, our Collagen Hot Chocolate is set to impress. The heavenly aroma, flavour and texture you’d expect, with the added bonus of 20g collagen protein. Please note, that due to the sourcing of the collagen, our Collagen Hot Chocolate is not suitable for those on a vegan or vegetarian diet.
