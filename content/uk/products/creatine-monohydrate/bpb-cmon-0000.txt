### FAQs

#### What is creatine monohydrate?

Creatine monohydrate is one of the most common forms of creatine. It is simply creatine with one water molecule attached to it, hence "monohydrate." This is thought to be the most absorbable and effective form of creatine. It works by enhancing energy production in the muscles, leading to increased physical activity in successive bursts of short-term, high-intensity exercise.

#### Is it safe to take creatine monohydrate everyday?

Yes, taking creatine monohydrate daily within recommended doses is generally safe and sees the best results for healthy individuals.

#### Does creatine make you stronger?

Long-term creatine supplementation (4-12 weeks) in combination with an effective training program can help increase both strength and muscle size. It enhances muscle performance by promoting the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy source for muscle contractions.

#### How long after taking creatine will I see results?

The timing of results can vary, but many individuals experience noticeable benefits from creatine supplementation within a few weeks. This is also dependent on consistent use of creatine, as well as adherence to an effective training plan.

#### Is a "loading phase" recommended?

While a loading phase can help saturate muscle stores more quickly, it is not necessary. Starting with a maintenance dose (around one serving per day) can still yield positive results over time. The decision to use a loading phase depends on personal preference and goals.
