FAQs

### FAQs

### What are the benefits of using Complete Multivitamin Complex™?

Our Complete Multivitamin Complex™ is designed to be the ultimate multivitamin supplement, to be taken 3 times daily after each meal. We designed it for anyone seeking a high-quality vitamin and mineral supplement to support their active lifestyle, making it a great way to supplement your diet to ensure you’re getting every nutrient you need, every single day.

### Who should take Complete Multivitamin Complex™?

Multivitamins are generally designed for anyone and everyone, which is why you can find multivitamin supplements for men and women. If you experience any long-term health conditions, or have any concerns about your health and dietary intake, you should of course consult with a doctor or medical professional before taking any multivitamin supplement.

### What does it taste like?

The great thing about our vitamin tablet options are how easy they are to take. No taste, no fuss - just take one with your breakfast, lunch and dinner and get on with your day, without having to overthink about your vitamin intake.

### Are there any dietary restrictions?

Whilst our Complete Multivitamin Complex tablets are unsuitable for Vegans, we have a great vegan option that does all of the same heavy lifting in terms of your vitamin intake.

### Should I take a multivitamin every day?

Multivitamins are typically designed as daily supplements. Some people choose to take multivitamins occasionally, depending on how they feel on that day. The only thing you shouldn’t do is take more than the recommended daily dose; your body can only process so much of each nutrient every day, so any excess will be wasted, but also, consuming too much of some nutrients can actually be harmful to your body, causing gastrointestinal discomfort and other mild health issues.
