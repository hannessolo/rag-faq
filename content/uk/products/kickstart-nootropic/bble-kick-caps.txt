### Kickstart Nootropic

Life is busy, there’s a lot going on and you can’t get in the zone. We hear you. If you’re feeling the need to focus, our Kickstart Nootropic is right with you. This feisty formula has been expertly created with 10 active ingredients, specifically targeted to support mental performance. Ready to kickstart your day?

Let’s take a look at what you’ll find in two easy-to-take capsules. Caffeine (100mg) sourced from guarana and green tea extracts is at the top of the list for alertness and concentration\*. Get that blood flowing\*\* with 200mg cocoa flavanols. Ginkgo biloba is a rich antioxidant, and we’ve packed 120mg in a potent 50:1 extract, which is equivalent to a mind-blowing 6g ginkgo leaves.

Now for a deeper dive. Hold on tight for this. Choline is a substance naturally found in the brain and helps raise the levels of important neurotransmitters (your body’s version of instant messaging). Acetylcholine (a compound of acetic acid and a molecule of choline) is one of these neurotransmitters. Although choline is produced by the body, there are times when it needs a little help from diet or supplementation. The dietary source is called citicoline. Cognizin® citicoline (100mg) is a patented form that is particularly effective in keeping this process running smoothly.

You’ll also find 100% reference daily intake of B vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, B6 and B12 to reduce tiredness and fatigue\*\*\*, contribute to normal mental performance\*\*\*\* and normal psychological function\*\*\*\*\*.

\* Caffeine helps to increase alertness and improve concentration.

\*\* Cocoa flavanols help maintain the elasticity of blood vessels, which contributes to normal blood flow. The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 200 mg of cocoa flavanols.

\*\*\* Vitamin B6 contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue.

\*\*\*\* Pantothenic Acid contributes to normal mental performance.

\*\*\*\*\* Vitamin B12 contributes to normal psychological function.
