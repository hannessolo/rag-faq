### DOMINATE™

The very best T-Support\* formula from Bulk™, containing 10 essential ingredients including zinc, Panax ginseng, maca root and selenium, dosed at optimal levels and combined into a pinnacle formula. Lab tested for banned substances and approved for professional athletes. If you don’t love it, we’ll give you your money back\*\*.

Dominate™ is our most premium testosterone support supplement, containing 10 ingredients and contributing to maintenance of normal blood testosterone levels\*.

Each of the ingredients in Dominate™ is dosed at optimal levels, and provided in a complete formula to provide the best possible benefits. We’ve listed the exact quantity of every ingredient so you know exactly what you’re putting in your body, and it’s tested for banned substances in an ISO 17025 approved laboratory under the Informed Sport programme, meaning it’s 100% approved for professional athletes and competitive trainers.

*   **D-Aspartic Acid**  
    One of the hottest ingredients in sports nutrition and academia. We’ve added 3000mg of high quality D-Aspartic Acid to Dominate™, the standard recommended dose.
    
*   **Fenugreek**  
    Fenugreek has been used in traditional cooking and medicine for thousands of years, and has attracted attention in recent years as a natural source of saponins and fenusides.
    
*   **Panax Ginseng**  
    Also known as Korean ginseng, Panax ginseng is an ancient herb that has been used for thousands of years, containing active components known as ginsenosides. This form of ginseng is reported to help with stamina\*\*\*, making it an ideal addition to workout supplements.
    
*   **Maca Root**  
    Maca is a vegetable extract from South America, popular in tablet and capsule forms. We added 50mg of a potent 10:1 maca extract to our Dominate™ formula.
    
*   **Zinc**  
    \*Zinc is an important mineral that plays a number of different roles in the body, including contributing to the maintenance of normal testosterone levels in the blood, fertility and reproduction and protein synthesis. We added 30mg of zinc in its highly bioavailable zinc citrate form.
    
*   **Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5):**  
    An essential B vitamin that contributes to normal energy yielding metabolism and cognitive performance, as well as synthesis and metabolism of hormones in the body.
    
*   **BioPerine®:**  
    BioPerine® is a natural thermonutrient that’s extracted from the Piper nigrum L plant (black pepper). We added 5mg to each serving to increase the absorption rate of all other ingredients.
    
*   **Selenium:**  
    An essential trace mineral that contributes to normal spermatogenesis, immune system function and cell protection from oxidative stress.
    
*   **Vitamin D3:**  
    Vitamin D3 contributes to normal muscle function, so we added an impressive 1000iu dose to round out our Dominate™ formula.
