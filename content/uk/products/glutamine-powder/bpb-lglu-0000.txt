Description

### Glutamine Powder

100% pure glutamine powder, containing 5g of l-glutamine in a single 5g serving in unflavoured variant, providing your body with an essential amino acid in an easy, mixable form.

Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid found in muscle, and a conditionally essential amino acid. Basically, that means that the body can synthesise it naturally, but your body’s levels of glutamine sometimes deplete faster than they can be replenished, such as during strenuous exercise.

Our glutamine powder provides an easy, mixable form of l-glutamine for you to enjoy post-workout as part of your regular nutritional intake.

\\

### Purpose

Our glutamine powder is for anyone who wants to ensure their body has optimum glutamine levels during the most vital periods, immediately after an intense workout session. Take a single serving after every workout, either on its own or mixed in with your favourite shake.

\\

### Benefits

*   Replenish Glutamine Levels

Ideally taken after every workout to maintain glutamine levels.

*   Made for Mixing

Available unflavoured so you can mix it in with your favourite shakes.

*   Incredible Value

100% purity at an incredible price.
