### Pump Pre-Workout

Our stimulant free, pump-based pre-workout formula, loaded with 9 active ingredients including L-citrulline, AAKG, OAKG, creatine and taurine to help you get the most out of your training sessions.

Pump Pre-Workout™ is a comprehensive pre-workout formula that’s totally stimulant free. That means it’s not loaded with caffeine, like traditional pre-workouts. Instead, we’ve packed it with 22g of active ingredients, split between 9 ingredients in high doses, creating a comprehensive pre-workout that’s appropriate for evening and late-night training sessions.

Pump Pre-Workout™ is potentially the most advanced pump-based pre-workout formula on the UK market, containing an impressive blend of unique ingredients that combine to provide a synergistic effect to aid you through your workout.

**L-Citrulline**

L-Citrulline is one of the most widely recognised pump ingredients, and we’ve dosed each serving with an impressive 6g measure.

**Glycerol Monostearate**

Glycerol monostearate is a hygroscopic chemical – that means its primary function is drawing in water. That’s why we recommend consuming Pump Pre-Workout™ with lots of water.

**Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AAKG)**

AAKG is a highly bioavailable form of the amino acid arginine, making it one of the most popular pre-workout ingredients in the market. Each serving of Pump Pre-Workout™ contains an impressive 3g of AAKG, double the dose of most competing products.

**Ornithine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (OAKG)**

Ornithine, arginine and citrulline each contribute to the same cycle in your body, so we added a dose of OAKG to complete the dose and provide your body with a steady supply of fuel.

**Creatine Monohydrate**

One of the most popular and widely researched supplements in sports nutrition, creatine helps to increase physical performance during successive bursts of short term, high intensity exercise. (The beneficial effect is obtained with a daily intake of 3 g of creatine.) We added a 3g dose to this formula to support your workout.

**Taurine**

A popular ingredient in many energy drinks, taurine is a naturally occurring amino acid commonly found in skeletal muscle.

**Beetroot Extract**

Relatively new in sports nutrition, beetroot extract is a rich natural source of nitrates and has been subject to several recent studies in exercise performance.

**Pine Bark Extract**

Another new ingredient, our pine bark extract is standardised to provide 95% proanthocyanidins, which are a class of polyphenols. We packed a 200mg dose into each serving of Pump Pre-Workout™.

**Vitamin B6**

As a final touch, we added 5mg of vitamin B6 to this formula to contribute to a reduction in tiredness and fatigue.

\\

### Purpose

Pump Pre-Workout™ is suitable for anyone looking for a potent, highly dosed pre-workout formula without the stimulant overload. Because this formula doesn’t contain caffeine, it’s ideal for evening and late-night training sessions, or anyone who wants to cut down their caffeine intake. Because it contains both glycerol monostearate and creatine monohydrate, we recommend drinking each serving with at least 500ml of water, and continuing to drink water throughout your workout. For this reason, it’s also better suited to submaximal lifting sessions than intense cardio exercise.
