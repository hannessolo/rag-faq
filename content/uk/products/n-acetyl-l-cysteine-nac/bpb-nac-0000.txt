L-cysteine is a semi-essential amino acid that occurs naturally in the body, and can also be found in foods like chicken, red peppers and egg yolks. Semi-essential means that your body can produce L-cysteine on its own, but it can’t always replenish your stores faster than you deplete it, such as during intensive exercise. Our NAC powder provides a pure source of l-cysteine in a stable, mixable form so you can integrate l-cysteine into your dietary intake.
