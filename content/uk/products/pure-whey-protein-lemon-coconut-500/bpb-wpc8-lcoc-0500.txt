### FAQs

### What are the benefits of using Pure Whey Protein™?

This is our bestselling protein powder formula for good reason. Pure Whey Protein™ contains everything you need to increase your protein intake as part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle, containing at least 22g protein with 5g BCAAs per scoop. It’s also incredibly versatile and can be added to baking, mixed into smoothies with fresh fruit or simply shaken up with water or milk.

### Who should take Pure Whey Protein™?

Pure Whey Protein™ is a great choice if you’re looking to increase your protein intake, particularly as part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. We only use premium whey protein which is sourced from the milk of European cows.

### What does it taste like?

Our Pure Whey Protein comes in a wide range of flavours — including chocolate, vanilla, fruits, and caramel. Because whey is a dairy-sourced protein, it typically has a creamy texture which works well in a shake.

### Are there any dietary restrictions?

Pure Whey Protein is not suitable for you if you follow a vegan diet — instead try our vegan protein range.
