We only use premium whey protein which is sourced from the milk of European cows. What does it taste like? Our Pure Whey Protein comes in a wide range of flavours — including chocolate, vanilla, fruits, and caramel. Because whey is a dairy-sourced protein, it typically has a creamy texture which works well in a shake. Are there any dietary restrictions? Pure Whey Protein is not suitable for you if you follow a vegan diet — instead try our vegan protein range. typeId recently-viewed count 6
