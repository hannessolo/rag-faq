If you’re asking yourself ‘Which [creatine supplement](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine) should I take?’ you’re in the right place.

It has been extensively researched for its benefit for increasing strength, gaining muscle and to supplement intense exercise.

In fact, The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition says that creatine monohydrate is the [most effective ergogenic nutritional supplement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2048496/#:~:text=They%20have%20been%20approved%20by,lean%20body%20mass%20during%20training.) currently available to athletes in terms of increasing lean body mass during training.

Here we break it down so you can understand the [benefits of creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/creatine-not-just-for-growth/) and the different types of creatine available.

**1\. CREATINE MONOHYDRATE**
----------------------------

[Creatine monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine) is the most common and most popular supplement form of creatine on the market.

It is made up of a creatine molecule bonded with a water molecule. Creatine monohydrate is water soluble, has good intestinal absorption and can be taken as a powder mixed with water, or in tablet format. 

Powdered creatine monohydrate is available in unflavoured (luckily this has a relatively mild taste), mixed berry flavour and apple & lime flavour. Each serving of the unflavoured version offers 5g of creatine monohydrate while the flavoured options contain 4g.

[Creatine monohydrate tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate-tablets-1000mg/bpb-cmon-tabs) contain 1g of creatine per tablet we recommend taking 3-5 tablets a day depending on your individual needs.

Most of the research on creatine supplements has been done on creatine monohydrate. Extensive research has shown that creatine monohydrate supplementation increases physical performance, increases muscle strength, muscular endurance and muscle mass, and improves maximum power output.

Many Creatine Monohydrate products have been shown to contain up to 5% impurities. The Creatine Monohydrate powder at **Bulk™** is refined to 99.9% purity, so you’re getting nothing but quality. 

For those who like to drink creatine with water, [flavoured creatine monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate/bpb-cmon-0000) is available now – from refreshing fruity flavours to more subtle ones, like vanilla.

**2\. CREATINE MONOHYDRATE (CREAPURE®)**
----------------------------------------

[Creapure®](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creapure-creatine-monohydrate/bpb-crea-0000) is a patent protected form of creatine monohydrate which undergoes a process of HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography), making it a form of micronized creatine.  

This process is undertaken to remove contaminants such as Creatinine, Dicyandiamide & Dihydrotriazine and guarantees 99.95% pure material. This is available in the form of an unflavoured powder.

**3\. CREATINE HYDROCHLORIDE (CREATINE HCL)**
---------------------------------------------

[Creatine Hydrochloride](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-hcl/bpb-chcl-0000) is creatine bonded with a hydrochloride salt, designed to enhance the absorption of creatine. It’s most commonly in powder form, such as Creatine HCL, and is an ideal addition to your post-workout formulas and [protein shakes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein). 

**4\. CREATINE ETHYL ESTER**
----------------------------

Often referred to as CEE, Creatine Ethyl Ester is simply creatine with an ester attached. This esterification occurs when carboxylic acid and alcohol react. Anecdotally, CEE users report less water retention when using this supplement, achieving a leaner look.-

However, despite anecdotal evidence of less water retention, there’s also a LOT of anecdotal evidence to suggest that the taste of CEE is less than pleasant.

**5\. CREATINE GLUCONATE**
--------------------------

Creatine Gluconate is creatine bonded with glucose (sugar), designed to enhance uptake in the muscles and intestinal absorption.

**Frequently asked questions**
------------------------------

### **What are the best types of creatine for cutting?**

Creatine does not directly affect fat loss. People take creatine to improve performance in high intensity exercise, helping to build muscle mass. Although creatine does not affect weight loss, it will help build muscle. This influences overall body composition.

### **WHICH types of CREATINE IS RIGHT FOR ME?**

Without doubt, the most popular form of is Creatine Monohydrate. If you’re thinking about using Creatine for the first time, this form is recommended.

Since it’s the subject of the most research, you can rest easy knowing the claims about creatine monohydrate are backed by science.

A [recent review of the research](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w) also suggested that other forms of creatine are not superior to creatine monohydrate in terms of how much creatine is absorbed, their impact on creatine levels in skeletal muscle or their impact on athletic performance.

### **What types of creatine are best for muscle growth?**

All creatine is beneficial for muscle gain. Creatine supplementation increases the stores of cellular phosphocreatine, which can accelerate the recycling of ADP into ATP, making more energy available for high-intensity exercise.

More creatine stores = more rapid energy.

If you’re looking for one answer though, it’s best to start with creatine monohydrate. This is creatine in its most basic and effective form. 

![3-simple-ways-to-train](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/090321_BULK_LOOK_04_081-1-533x355.jpg)

### **What are the purest types of creatine?**

If you want the absolute purest Creatine Monohydrate and budget is no issue, Creatine Monohydrate (Creapure®) is a great choice. This delivers all the benefits of Monohydrate but with the assurance that the supplement is 99.9% pure – free of impurities such as Creatinine, Dicyandiamide & Dihydrotrizine.

### **Does creatine cause water retention?**

If you’re conscious about water retention (NB: the retention of water in muscle cells actually plays an important role in performance) then consider Creatine Ethyl Ester or Creatine Ethyl Ester Malate.

Both forms are metabolised differently to regular Creatine Monohydrate, theoretically reducing the level of retained water. 

That being said, while there is some evidence to suggest that creatine supplementation increases water retention in the short term, other studies that suggest that creatine does not increase total body water relative to muscle mass in the long term.

It’s best to see how you feel after several weeks or months of supplementing.

### **Is creatine low in carbohydrates?**

If you need to be careful of the level of carbohydrates you consume, Creatine Gluconate or Creatine HCL might be good alternatives to standard forms. Due to how these forms are bonded, their respective absorption rates are perceived to be enhanced – meaning that, in theory, less carbohydrate is required in order to aid the process of delivering the nutrients to the liver and muscle cells.

That being said, there is limited research to support how effective these are vs a carb ingested variant.
