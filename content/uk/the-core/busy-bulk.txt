BULK POWDERS™ are busy as ever – after a successful weekend at Body Power in Birmingham, it’s onward to Boston, USA, to support our athlete James DeGale in his world title fight. The fight against American Andre Dirrell, is being shown live on Sky Sports at 20:00 on Saturday 23rd May.

The fight week will involve the press conference on Thursday, weigh-in on Friday and then the big fight on Saturday night. James is currently in Miami, putting the finishing touches to a successful training camp before flying to Boston.

James said, “I feel great, my best shape ever. Training has been fantastic and I can’t wait to get in the ring on Saturday.” Judging from the picture below from James’ Instagram ([https://instagram.com/jamesdegale\_/](https://instagram.com/jamesdegale_/)), James is indeed in phenomenal shape, and has clearly been enjoying his BULK POWDERS™ products!
