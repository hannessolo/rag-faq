The old saying ‘cheaters never prosper’ was something drummed into most of us when we were kids, but what about a cheat meal? 

A cheat meal is often also referred to as a ‘refeed’ – which is basically a surplus of calories (usually higher in carbohydrates and fats) scheduled, generally once a week, as a reward for sticking to a particular dietary regime.

### **THE THINKING BEHIND IT.**

Knowing that your body will be under calorie restrictions, with carbohydrates being the one we tend to feel the most, the two hormones Leptin, and it’s counterpart Ghrelin, are the key drivers that tell us when we are hungry or full. Leptin (a protein produced in fat cells) tells the brain (via the Hypothalamus) we have enough fat stores in the body, and in turn controls our appetite / hunger. Now, from our self inflicted diets, fat loss occurs, meaning we have less Leptin being produced. So when we lose fat, our hormones are automatically altered.

Ghrelin is an appetite stimulant that signals the release of growth hormone and is produced by the stomach when it is empty, and again, like Leptin, flags to the Hypothalamus that a signal is needed to tell the body to eat. Not really what we want to hear when dieting, as an ’empty’ stomach is part and parcel of the diet after all.

### **HERE’S WHERE THE CHEAT MEAL COMES IN.**

When used correctly, a cheat meal can alter hormones responsible for metabolism and insulin regulation, raise our glycogen stores for increased energy, and keep our calorie burning and fat utilisation the number one priority.

Now there are various levels of dieting, and individual needs for certain body fat levels, with a competition bodybuilder being the extreme, aiming for very low levels of body fat (~4/5%) at increased risk of hormone imbalances that would normally regulate energy / calorie usage, body weight and fat mass stability, control the suppression of hunger, and ultimately metabolism – with metabolic damage a real possibility.

Once a cheat meal is consumed, the increase in metabolism can last for several days after your body digests it, (even if your stomach doesn’t think so), offsetting the drop in hormones that occurs when the calorie deficit is resumed once more.

This, ‘stoking of the fire’ as it’s sometimes called can yield results, and break through plateaus that can happen when the body starts to self-regulate to a particular regime.

### **THE NOT-SO-SCIENCE-Y BIT.**

Cheat meals can really be something to look forward to, and can also give you a chance to eat ‘normally’ with family or friends for that chosen time, so timings can enhance the benefit of the cheat meal, to extend it to social situations. As such, the weekend is generally the most logical time to refeed, with the evening meal being the most suitable as you are less likely to continue eating as the evening draws to a close, opposed to say breakfast – it’s a long day ahead otherwise!

A common issue with this kind of dieting that people encounter is the ability to do things in moderation. After a week of restrictive eating, having a cheat meal that is truly one portion and then going back to the chicken breasts and broccoli doesn’t seem so appetising. 

### **POPULAR CHEAT DAY PRODUCTS.**

You can’t really go far wrong with a good old tub of [Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut), or any of our nut butters for that matter! They all contain high amounts of protein and fats, supplying the calories you need to replenish your calorie stores. For an extra carb hit, our [Protein Snack Bars](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/protein-bars) are just the ticket – and when they taste this good, it’s hard to put them down.
