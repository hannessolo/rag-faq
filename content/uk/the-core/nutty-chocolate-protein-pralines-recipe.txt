Lucy at Pole Fit and Flexy has taken a break from spinning round her pole to give us this recipe for some gorgeous Chocolate Protein Pralines. Each has just 42 calories and 2.5g protein, made with our Beef Protein Isolate. Weâ€™ll take five!

### Instructions:

1.) Add the peanut butter, honey and coconut oil into a microwaveable bowl. Microwave until melted then stir.

2.) Stir in the cocoa powder and protein powder then mix thoroughly.

3.) Spoon the mixture into a silicone chocolate mould.

4.) Tap the mould on a hard surface to release any air bubbles then place flat in the fridge for 3-4 hours or until completely set.

5.) Turn the chocolates out and enjoy.
