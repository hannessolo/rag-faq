Although we see ourselves as a brand who offers unbeatable prices on sports nutrition and bodybuilding supplements, we’re also becoming more prevalent amongst our dedicated endurance customers. BULK POWDERS™ are the official sponsors of the cycle racing team Team Swift as well as one of their riders. We also sponsor 16 year old [Junior GB triathlete Whitney Larkin](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/bulk-powders-form-partnership-junior-gb-triathlete-whitney-larkin/ "Junior GB triathlete Whitney Larkin"). This is a real breakthrough into the endurance market and shows how our supplements can benefit their training.

Endurance exercise is training the aerobic system, rather than the anaerobic. Marathons, road cycling, competitive swimming, duathlons and triathlons, are all perfect examples of endurance training.

Successful endurance athletes are those who can perform at a high level but with minimal effort. This is primarily due to genetics, training and diet, although supplements play a huge role too. They can be a god send when you’re running low on muscle glycogen stores or feeling fatigued due to a loss of electrolytes.

We have a large and expanding range of **endurance products** on sale, covering every stage of your training/competition. Here are a few of our recommendations to help you reach your current endurance goals.

PRE Training
------------

### Vitargo

Patented sports performance carbohydrate clinically proven to improve performance. This super soluble and sugar free energy boost will fuel your muscles with glycogen without any sugar crash later on. Try taking [Vitargo®](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitargo.html "Vitargo for endurance athletes") immediately after exercise to replenish muscle glycogen 70% faster than other carbohydrates.

### Dextrose & Maltodextrin 50:50

50:50 blend of two popular, rapidly absorbing carbohydrate powders that will help prevent early fatigue. Also take immediately post exercise for muscle repair and growth.

_NB. Carb Loading – how much/when?_

_Try consuming around 8g/kg of body weight of carbohydrates 3 days before an event. Then every hour consume 1g/kg of body weight. This way you keep your blood sugar levels elevated and thereby ensure optimal physical performance._

### Caffeine

Although seen as a powerful stimulant, caffeine can be a great supplement for endurance athletes. Its effects on rate of perceived exertion (RPE) mean you are able to train harder for longer. One study showed 6mg/kg of body weight significantly increasing VO2 and energy expenditure.

INTRA Training
--------------

### Complete Hydration Drink™

[Tri-carb blend](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-hydration-drink.html "Complete Hydration Drink™") with added aminos, electrolytes and b vitamins. The ideal all in one solution for use during endurance exercise, such as cycling.

### Electrolyte Powder

Sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium are generally lost during sweating. It is essential to replace these in order to prevent any negative effects on performance, such as dehydration and cramping. [Electrolytes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/electrolyte-powder.html "Electrolyte Powder for endurance athletes") also help mentally during endurance training, supporting you to perform repetitive myofibril contractions.

### Choline Bitartrate

Low choline levels link strongly to fatigue, slow reaction times and deliriousness that occur during endurance training. Choline is best suited for those competing in endurance events lasting for 2 hours or longer, when low choline levels occur.

POST Training
-------------

### Complete Recovery™

This strong [recovery supplement](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-recovery.html "Recovery supplement for endurance athletes") is a must for any endurance athlete. As we all know, recovery is as vital as the training, which can significantly impair your next training session if not done correctly. Supplement with this highly dosed, quality recovery drink in the anabolic phase where your muscle cells are most sensitive to insulin.

### Montmorency Tart Cherry Extract

This very potent antioxidant protects against free radical damage as well as acting against inflammation. It also has a link to promoting sleep due to it being a rich source of melatonin.

### Complete Joint Restore™

[Joint care](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-joint-restore.html "Joint supplement for healthy joints") is vital for any athlete. This formula incorporates some of the most researched ingredients around to support healthy cartilage.

### Complete Multivitamin Complex™

Our ever popular multivitamin has 30 vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, probiotics, fruit and plant sources. With the inclusion of Vitamin C and Probiotics, the risk of upper respiratory tract infections are significantly reduced.

_NB: Other products to consider_

_Protein isn’t just for bodybuilders. Protein is rich in BCAAs and Glutamine which are perfect for growth and repair of muscles. Alternatively try our [BCAA Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/instantised-bcaa.html "Instant BCAA Powder") or water soluble N Acetyl L Glutamine._
