This vegan burger is packed with 18g of protein. Perfect to eat solo or stacked to the heavens with all your favourite things.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.) Blend lentils with all wet ingredients and flaxegg in a high speed blender, and pour mixture into a bowl.

2.) Fold in the remaining ingredients until you get a moldable consistency. If too wet, add further dry ingredients, or if too dry, do the opposite.

3.) Mold into 6 chunky burger patties or 8-10 smaller patties.

4.) You can store these away in the fridge, or to keep them for longer, you can pop them in the freezer.

5.) To cook them, heat 1 tsp of coconut oil on a non-stick pan on medium heat. Wait until the oil is hot before putting them on.

6.) Sizzle for several minutes on each side and stack it up as you please.

We had ours with some gluten free burger buns, vegan cheese slices, lettuce, tomato and of course… fried onions.

How will you have yours?
