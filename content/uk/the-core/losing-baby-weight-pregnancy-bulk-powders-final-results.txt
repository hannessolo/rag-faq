Lorraine’s BULK POWDERS™ 30 Day Weight Loss Challenge – The Final Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’re checking in for the final time with Lorraine, mum of two and founder of onlinemummy.co.uk. For the last four weeks Lorraine has been taking part in her 30 day baby weight loss challenge. As a mum of two young children Lorraine knows first hand that having a baby is an experience that changes your body – and doesn’t always give it back. Lorraine decided to take control of her lifestyle and get back to her pre-baby body through introducing a healthy diet, exercise regime and supplementing her diet with [Pure Whey Isolate™ 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-isolate-90.html "Pure Whey Isolate") (chocolate) and [CLA Softgels](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cla-conjugated-linoleic-acid-softgels.html "CLA Softgels"). Lorraine aimed to lose weight, tone up and feel healthier.

For Lorraine, ditching the calorie counting and focusing on a consistent and healthy 3-meals-a-day diet with a few treats here and there has seen some great results. Lorraine has had a piece of cake now and again, but has bypassed cheat meals. She didn’t track her calories throughout the challenge, but kept her diet largely the same for the four weeks.

Using our protein and weight loss supplements to help lose baby weight
----------------------------------------------------------------------

By supplementing her diet with CLA, Lorraine’s body effectively diverted calories usually stored in fat cells towards muscle cells. Not only did she feel that the [CLA Softgels](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cla-conjugated-linoleic-acid-softgels.html "CLA Softgels") supported her in achieving her goals, she also felt they gave her the biggest inch loss – 3 inches from her stomach.

[Pure Whey Isolate 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-isolate-90.html "Whey Isolate Protein") was used daily as part of a high protein diet throughout the 30 days. Our Whey Isolate is arguably the best value Whey Protein Isolate in Europe with less than 1g of fat and carbohydrate per serving. Lorraine used it primarily after her workouts alongside gentle stretches and a cool down. By drinking Pure Whey Isolate 90 protein shakes to refuel her body, Lorraine found she could do a harder workout without feeling sore the day after. It also helped her get through some 8 mile runs.

Overall, she doesn’t feel she could have achieved the same results if she hadn’t been taking the supplements – and also credits them with giving her the drive she needed.

Exercise and diet
-----------------

Her exercise regime consisted of 3 ‘types of workout’; legs, arms and abs. This routine, taking 30 minutes each and performed every day of the challenge, saw some great results. In fact, Lorraine is going to continue with her new lifestyle to achieve a new set of goals she has set for herself – and by not choosing an impossible to follow diet and exercise plan she is able to sustain the healthy changes she has made to her life.

Lorraine chose not to count calories and step on the scales – choosing instead to measure her target areas in order to track progress. Over the four weeks she saw a steady inch loss across her whole body which has resulted in a whopping **8 inch loss in total**!

The biggest area she lost inches from was her waist and she has dropped a dress size overall. Her ab exercises aided by the CLA Softgels have worked to target the area she was most looking to improve on. Good work Lorraine!

Feeling inspired? The hard work starts now!
-------------------------------------------

Having put in some hard work throughout August, the results speak for themselves. So if you’re feeling inspired just remember there are no ‘quick fixes’ or ‘miracle diets’ that will give you long term success to a better body – Lorraine achieved her goals through healthy eating with a supplemented diet and regular exercise. It’s important to remember that getting fit is a safe process and for new mothers, waiting 6 weeks before starting your exercise regime is recommended.

Lorraine has shared her final pictures. We’re really pleased to see her achieve fantastic results and to have helped in supporting her on her journey to a yummy mummy.
