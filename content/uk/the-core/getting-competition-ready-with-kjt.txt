A long list of major events have been cancelled or postponed over the past year due to the impact of coronavirus. None more significant in the global sporting calendar than the 2020 Olympic Games. While as spectators this is disappointing, it’s the athletes themselves that are impacted the most by the uncertainty and such a major change to the calendar. 

Our very own #TeamBulk ambassador Katarina Johnson-Thompson (KJT) is one of the athletes preparing for this summers’ Olympic Games one year later than expected. KJT is currently a World, Commonwealth, European Indoor and World Indoor Champion as well as the British Record holder for the Heptathlon (outdoors) and Pentathlon (indoors). Away from the track she’s a proud ambassador for the LFC Foundation and founder of the KJT Academy, an academy supporting young athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds and diverse ethnic communities in the NW of England.

We spoke with KJT to see how she has been getting on ahead of the upcoming event.

### Hi Katarina, how are you feeling about the upcoming Olympic Games?

It’s been a long journey to this Olympics and I, along with everyone else hoping to be there, am just looking forward to them finally arriving. The last 4 and a half years have had their ups and downs, even more so than a normal Olympic cycle, but once we get there and see the flame burning in Tokyo it will all have been worth it.   

### How far in advance do you prepare for a competition like the Olympic Games?

The Olympics are supposed to be in 4 year cycles. Obviously this time around it has been extended to 5 due to covid-19, but for that whole length of time the Olympics is the focus. It is the pinnacle in any athlete’s career, so you spend the time between games getting ready for the next one. Those years in between are all about just getting as ready as you can for the big one.

### Did the change in timing affect your preparation?

The uncertainty around the Olympics last year wasn’t ideal for anyone and I think the hardest part of it all was the limbo we found ourselves in during the early part of the pandemic. We were being asked to prepare for an Olympics without being able to access the facilities that we needed which was stressful for everyone. Once they finally moved the Games, that gave us some clarity and allowed us to plan again and focus on the new target.

### How key is diet and nutrition to your overall training program?

What I eat and how you fuel your body is such an important part of the program. It literally gives me the energy I need to train and compete. Having the right nutrition helps with allowing my body to rest and recover correctly, repairing muscle fatigue after a tough session or competition. You are dealing with such small margins in elite sport that not paying attention to your nutrition would be like not having a training plan.

### Is there a way that you track how your nutrition plan is going?

I don’t count calories or anything like that. I always say the key is having a balanced diet and everything in moderation. I’ve gotten to know what my body needs. For example, I know if I have a big training session, I need to take on more calories so I’ll pack an additional Macro Munch™ bar to help get me through.

### Which bulk™ products do you use the most?

I integrate bulk™ products in several ways. Little things like the goji berries in my smoothie are easy wins as I know the product is exactly what I need to get going in the morning. The whey protein is then essential for after every session, when I need the right things quickly for recovery. On the road essentials are the [Marco Munch™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-bar-V2/mmun-pbar-v2) protein bars and the flapjacks. I love them, they taste great and are just what I need during a busy week.

### Physically, how intense does training preparation become?

I’m training for 7 different events so it does get intense, and that’s before you even think about any additional strength and conditioning work. Some days it will be 2- or 3-hours sessions twice a day, other days it will be one longer session. It can be tough but I enjoy the variety! In any of the 7 events when you do a personal best, or hit your target in training, you know you are getting near to where you need to be and that’s exciting. You have different plans throughout the year but it’s a nice lift if you are hitting your targets in the summer as you know you are peaking at just the right time.

### How do you mentally prepare for a competition?

I’ve learned over the years to switch off. It’s impossible to be constantly worrying about athletics, training, competition or whatever so a big part of my preparation is doing things that I enjoy that can help me to relax, like reading. When it gets closer to a major competition, I work with a sports psychologist who has basically helped me to overcome situations by just controlling the controllable elements. It sounds cliché but I try to get to that start line, knowing I have prepared as well as I can and that’s it. If you do that you won’t have many worries or complaints.

### How important is getting into a good mindset? 

Ha-ha I feel like I’ve said this every time, but mindset is essential as well! If you eat right, rest and recover well and approach your sport with the right mentality you are a long way towards reaching your potential. For many athletes mindset can be make or break, the difference between achieving your dreams and not.

### And the importance of recovery through training? 

Like nutrition you can’t overstate the importance of recovery. As a young athlete these are often the areas that you pay the least attention to but as you develop, you begin to understand how you eat, how you rest, how you mentally switch off really make a huge difference.

Goodluck KJT! We will be cheering you on here at bulk™
