Beetroots are considered a superfood because they’re jam packed full of nitrates which help to increase blood flow. They’re also full of potassium, magnesium, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folic acid, protein and antioxidants. A right powerhouse!

When she’s not lifting heavy weights over her head at CrossFit Chester and CrossFit 1664, Lindsay aka Lean Bean Nutrition bakes delicious brownies. Here’s her latest recipe.

### **Instructions**

1.) Preheat oven to 180C  
2.) In a bowl soak the dates in warm water (enough to cover the surface of the dates). Once soft, blend into a caramel paste.  
3.) Add the beetroot to the caramel and blend  
4.) Add melted chocolate, whey protein, egg and peanut butter. Combine  
5.) Pour into a lined tin, drizzle with additional peanut butter and white chocolate chips  
6.) Bake for 15-18 minutes  
7.) Allow to cool
