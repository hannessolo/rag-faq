### [Fruit, Nut & Seed Mix](../../fruit-nut-seed-mix.html)

Simple but effective – this combination of fruits, nuts and seeds is a perfect addition to most food plans. We’ve sourced **9 different fruits, nuts and seeds** for you, and combined them in to one tasty snack pack! Each bag includes a mix of assorted cashew nuts, pecan nuts, apricots, cranberries, raisins, golden raisins, cherries, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds, which delivers a source of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Sprinkle over cereals, add to natural yoghurt or simply consume straight from the bag to support your nutritional requirements.

#### _My Calorie Expenditure is crazily high being a Triathlete, so finding this was a god-send! It tastes awesome, provides a great source of complex CHO, and has the goodness of quality ingredients such as the Chia. I use it at breakfast, and also post workout (I mix up my choc protein shake, and pour over the granola – perfect)!! – Marko

### [Complete Protein Yogurt Powder](../../complete-protein-yogurt-powder.html)™

Arguably one of our greatest tasting and most refreshing powdered drinks to date, Complete Protein Yogurt Powder™ combines the finest ingredients with luxurious flavour. With the unique blend of Yogurt, Quark and Whey Protein Concentrate you get both fast and slow digesting proteins with a comprehensive amino acid profile – **there’s no other product like it on the market**. Each serving also delivers over 21g protein which will contribute to a growth of muscle mass and the inclusion of prebiotic fibres and probiotics replicate that of a typical yogurt drink.

Complete Protein Yogurt Powder comes in two delicious flavours which include Black Cherry and Peach Melba – both of these flavours have been carefully constructed to provide a luxurious yogurt taste, matching some of the best confectionary yogurts on the market. If you are struggling for that extra protein intake, are looking for something new or want an alternative shake to add to your diet, then Complete Protein Yogurt Powder™ is perfect for you.

PURE SERIES™

### [Coconut Oil Softgels 1000mg](../../coconut-oil-softgels.html)

Designed for the most convenient source of consuming your healthy fats, Coconut Oil Softgels provide 1000mg of pure, 100% Virgin Coconut Oil with **absolutely no fillers or additives**. The convenient soft gel form makes it even easier to incorporate Coconut Oil in to your diet. It is perfect for those who aren’t too keen on the taste, but would still like the benefits of the oil. Unlike many other cheap sources of Coconut Oil, the oil used in the soft gels is non-hydrogenated, unrefined and guaranteed hexane-free – ensuring the absolute highest quality source of Coconut Oil possible.

### **[Creatine Monohydrate Tablets](../../creatine-monohydrate-tablets-1000mg.html)**

Creatine Monohydrate Tablets provide an even more convenient way of consuming Creatine when on the go. Each tablet contains 1000mg of Creatine Monohydrate, making it super effective and easy to consume. Creatine has been shown to **increase physical performance in successive bursts of short term, high intensity exercise** and is particularly popular for sports of this nature, such as bodybuilding, powerlifting, rugby and football. We recommend consuming 3-5 tablets a day to get to 3-5g of Creatine Monohydrate.

### **[Cinnamon Extract Powder](../../cinnamon-extract-powder.html)**

Cinnamon Extract Powder is derived from the oil of the inner bark of the Cinnamomum Cassia Tree, native to East Asia. This essential oil found in the tree contains high levels of Terpenoids, which are where the goodness of Cinnamon is found. BULK POWDERS™ Cinnamon Extract Powder is found in a market leading 30:1 ratio, which makes it far more concentrated than standard ground Cinnamon. In fact, **each 100mg of Cinnamon Bark Extract is equal to a massive 3g of Cinnamon**.

### **BULK POWDERS™ [Hydracup Dual Shaker](../../hydracup-dual-shaker-clear.html)**

BULK POWDERS™ have teamed up with HydraCup™ to bring you the BULK POWDERS™ custom HydraCup™ Dual Shaker Bottle. The HydraCup™ Dual Shaker Bottles offer incredible convenience, due to having two completely separate mixing compartments – this offers a wide range of uses, making it one of the most popular shakers on the market.
