In little over 36 hours over 70 contestants will arrive at the Bedford Civic Hall to compete in the **NPA British Finals 2015** – the largest all natural bodybuilding competition in the UK.

With all 5 qualifiers now completed, Sunday will witness a fierce competition, contested in great spirits of course, with some World Class physiques on show!

Now in its twelfth year, the **[NPA (Natural Physique Association)](http://www.npabodybuilding.com/)** continues to go from strength to strength. It’s an association built on sound principles – to inspire you to create the best body you can by following a Natural Bodybuilding lifestyle.

You probably wouldn’t believe it, but athletes are drug tested and polygraphed as standard! Very few competitions go to this level of scrutiny to maintain the integrity of the sport – and that’s what makes the NPA so unique.

This is our 3rd year supporting the NPA and it gives us great delight to see two of our athletes, **[Matt Argall](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/the-competition-diet-top-tips-from-world-champion-bodybuilder-matt-argall/)** and **[Rachael Owen](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/fit-mum-no-problem-rachael-owen/)**, competing and representing **BULK POWDERS™** in the finals this weekend.

Matt, a lifetime natural bodybuilder, is a two-time NPA British U70kg Lightweight winner. He has a wealth of training and competitive experience behind him; his commitment and consistency is astonishing.

Rachael, a PT and natural bodybuilder, is competing in her first NPA finals this year. Having won the NPA Yorkshire Trained Figure class, she’s on track to put in a fantastic performance when she gets up on stage on Sunday. Rachael’s progress and dedication this past year has been exceptional – she’s a credit to us and herself, and an inspiration to so many.

The NPA doesn’t always get the recognition it deserves, and that’s a shame. These are, after all, athletes who show real guts and sacrifice to achieve the physique’s they do. There are no shortcuts here – just a desire to sculpt the best physique possible, achievable only through rigorous training and a meticulous approach to nutrition.

And this is why we align so well with an organisation like the NPA – because it’s **100% transparent** – just like our supplements. You know exactly what you’re getting from us when you buy a product; absolute quality ingredients, at the best prices on the market.

Why not head to **The Civic Hall, High Street, Bedworth, CV12 8NF** and watch the NPA Finals this Sunday? With so many top physiques on show, it’s practically impossible not to get inspired!

But if that’s motivation enough, **Simon Jurkiw**, our world-renowned Product Development Director will be in attendance too, sampling a range of our fantastic products, including the ever-popular **[High Protein Snack Bars](../../high-protein-snack-bars-box-of-12.html)**, **[High Protein Flapjacks](../../high-protein-flapjacks.html)**, and our recently launched **Chocolate Whey Balls**, to name a few.

Good luck to Matt and Rachael, **Team BULK POWDERS™** are 100% behind you. And best of luck to everyone else competing on the day. The NPA is always superbly run, so whether you’re taking part or simply spectating, you’ll be sure to have a great time.
