Happy birthday to us! We’ve been pushing since ’06, when Bulk started from a spare bedroom, dedicated to empowering every athlete and every person with the right nutrition and inspiration they need – to achieve their goals and go beyond them. Not only will we be sharing daily deals on a huge range of products to celebrate, but you will find discounts throughout every single product category across our website. Now, it wouldn’t be a party without gifts. This year, with every order over £4o you’ll not only get a free, limited edition birthday shaker, but you can also choose from a delicious, protein-packed gift of your choice. We’ve developed two tasty treats, fit for any birthday celebration with a vegan option for all of our plant-powered friends. We want to be the sports and active nutrition brand for everyone. Empowering athletes with unparalleled sports and performance supplements, and inspiring every person to create their own life-changing journey with the right nutrition and expertise. Find out more about the evolution of Bulk [here](https://www.bulk.com/uk/about).

After seeing the popularity of our birthday cake [Vegan Protein Blondie](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-blondie/vser-vpbr-blon) last year, we had no choice but to add a new flavour into the mix. A delightful combination of sweet and salty, we are excited to introduce you to our new **Salted Caramel Vegan Blondie**: a soft baked sweet treat embedded with creamy dark chocolate chips. With 15g of protein per blondie, if you’re in need of a plant protein hit, whether at the gym or wanting a guilt-free treat, look no further. Also high in fibre, this is the perfect snack to keep you going throughout the day.
