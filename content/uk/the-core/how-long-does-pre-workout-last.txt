[Pre-workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/pre-workout) is becoming an increasingly popular supplement for athletes and fitness enthusiasts to support and enhance their training. But how long does pre-workout last? Here we look at what pre-workout is, how it works and how long it stays in your system. 

Dope Pre-Workout

**What is pre-workout?**
------------------------

Pre-workout is a supplement designed to be consumed before exercise (hence the name). While the formulas vary, multi-ingredient pre-workout typically consists of a blend of caffeine, branched-chain amino acids ([BCAAs](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/instantised-bcaa/bpb-ibca-0000)), nitrates, [creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine), [beta alanine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/beta-alanine/bpb-bala-0000) and other ingredients [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6083567/).

The ingredients will be tailored to complement the specific activity or audience they’re designed for, to provide ergogenic aid for active individuals. Essentially, it’s designed to give you a boost just before you step on the gym floor.

### **Benefits of pre-workout** 

*   **Increased energy** – Pre-workouts contain vitamin B6, which can contribute to reducing fatigue and tiredness.
*   **Improved focus** – The caffeine in pre-workout may elicit a positive effect on cognitive function, improving mental focus and concentration.

**How long does pre-workout last?**
-----------------------------------

**30 minutes to 2.5 hours.**

Multiple factors affect how long the effects of pre-workout will last including dosage, ingredients, tolerance and workout intensity.

Increased physical and mental energy as a result of taking pre-workout is typically experienced for anywhere between 30 minutes to two and a half hours.

----------------------------------------------

### **Dosage**

The dosage of pre-workout affects the length of time the benefits are experienced. The more you take, the longer it will affect you.

Higher doses may elongate the period where energy levels feel greater and have been shown to lower feelings of exertion [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7240597/). This effect could be attributable to the dose of individual ingredients.

Remember to only take the recommended dose. This is crucial.

### **Ingredients** 

The effects of pre-workout depend on the ingredients used and their respective doses. Each ingredient offers something different, so pre-workouts with more of one thing may affect you in different ways.

We’ll look into these ingredients more closely below, but they include caffeine, nitrates, creatine and beta alanine.

#### **Caffeine**

Caffeine is present in multiple beverages including coffee, tea and energy drinks. The effects of caffeine are typically experienced for 2.5 to 4.5 hours but this varies greatly between individuals [\[4\]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/ExerciseAndAthleticPerformance-Consumer/).

#### **Nitrates**

To improve endurance levels, pre-workouts contain nitrates or amino acids that stimulate the production of nitrate oxide, which lowers the oxygen demand during exercise [\[5\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23580439/). Once consumed, nitrates peak after 1-3 hours [\[6\]](https://www.scienceinsport.com/sports-nutrition/what-are-nitrates-and-why-should-i-use-them/).

#### **Beta alanine**

Beta alanine is an amino acid that exhibits multiple benefits when consumed before exercise. This includes increased aerobic and anaerobic endurance, increased muscle mass, increased exercise capacity and helps reduce lactic acid buildup [\[7\]](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/beta-alanine-benefits/).

After consumption, beta alanine returns to baseline concentrations after 3 hours but typically peaks at 30-40 minutes post-ingestion [\[8\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16554972/).

### **Tolerance**

Consistent use or overuse of pre-workout for a prolonged period may result in your body building up a tolerance to its effects [\[9\]](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a26075019/pre-workout-complete-guide/). For this reason, it’s recommended to cycle pre-workout and have 6-8 week breaks from using the supplement.

Some people opt to take a stim-free pre-workout to cycle. This is a clever idea and will work. However, this too should be cycled to ensure tolerance to other ingredients does not arise.

### **Intensity of workout**

The intensity of exercise influences the exact duration of pre-workout effects. Individual ingredients may be ‘used up’ faster during high-intensity exercise periods. 

Lower-intensity training may not utilise pre-workout to the fullest and not all of the benefits will be experienced, therefore pre-workout is mainly used for high-intensity exercise. However, some studies suggest taking [pre-workout for cardio](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/cardio-and-pre-workout/) can be effective. 

**How long before a session should I take pre-workout?**
--------------------------------------------------------

There’s lots of guidance on this. Some recommendations are 15-30 mins before training [\[10\]](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/workout-supplements/), while others recommend 20-60 mins [\[11\]](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/what-is-pre-workout/). Within either of these timeframes is fine. Anything over an hour is probably too long, whereas less than 15 minutes is too soon.

The time in these studies is calculated by assessing the half-life of the ingredients and their absorption. So there is science behind it. But ultimately, the best time is when it feels right for you. Try a different range of times to see which gets you popping.

**What are the different types of pre-workout?**
------------------------------------------------

### **Complete**

Complete pre-workouts are suitable for everyone, from athletes to those just starting their training journey. Perfect all-rounder pre-workout drinks. Complete formulas typically contain caffeine, BCAAs, beta-alanine, and citrulline. 

### **Custom**

It’s now possible to create your custom pre-workout formula by combining raw materials. This allows you to [personalise your pre-workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/personalise-your-pre-workout/) formulas to complement your own specific needs and desires.

So whether you want a pump-focused formula or one that prioritises endurance, this method allows you complete control of each ingredient and its dose.

### **Elite**

Elite pre-workouts are specifically designed to meet the needs of professional athletes, bodybuilders and powerlifters. This is mainly because they have strict rules from [WADA](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list) and other governing bodies as to what can and cannot be inside. [Elevate Pre-Workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/elevate/bpps-elev), therefore, is batch-tested and checked by [Informed Sport](https://sport.wetestyoutrust.com/).

### **Stim-free**

Although caffeine is a standard ingredient in pre-workouts, not everyone drinks it. [Caffeine-free pre-workouts](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-pre-workout-caffeine-free/bble-cpcf) are ideal for anyone who likes to train in the evening or those who experience caffeine sensitivity.

**How long does pre-workout last before it expires?**
-----------------------------------------------------

Pre-workouts typically have an expiry date of between six months to two years, depending on the manufacturer. However, it is best to use within a 2-3 month period once opened. This is because the supplement is exposed to certain elements such as air and light, which can potentially compromise its quality.

It’s also good to note that once the supplement has been mixed with water or another beverage it is best consumed within 12 hours of dilution to maintain its potency.

**Summary: How long does pre-workout last in your system?**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Pre-workout is an incredible supplement to help you get the most out of intense workouts. Studies suggest it should be consumed 30 minutes before your session for optimal effects.

You should expect to feel the benefits for up to two and a half hours, but be aware that this may vary due to the factors spoken about in this article.
