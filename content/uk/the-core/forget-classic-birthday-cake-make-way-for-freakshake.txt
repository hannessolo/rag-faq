This year we’re turning 14 and decided that a standard birthday cake wasn’t going to cut it. We put a twist on the classic birthday dessert and created the amazing Birthday Cake Freakshake. And yes, it’s as spectacular as it sounds.

So here’s a little treat from us to you. This Birthday Cake Freakshake recipe is as easy as it’s delicious – think smooth and creamy glory with a sprinkle finish. Of course, it wouldn’t be a bulk™ birthday shake without a couple of scoops of our superstar whey protein powder. We’ve made it extra special this year and created a custom birthday cake flavour. Just in case you were wondering, our gourmet high-protein bar Macro Munch also makes a special appearance and gets the place of honour at the top of the shake tower – in the Brilliant Birthday Cake flavour, naturally. We just can’t get enough of it.

We want this birthday shake to be the ultimate indulgent treat for a truly special occasion. That’s why we’re not even sorry about skipping our macro counting this time. Enjoy this recipe to the fullest without any maths involved. We hope it’ll become a staple for birthdays and many more cheat days to come.

Read on to find out all about the ingredients and steps to make our unique Birthday Cake Freakshake recipe.
