BULK POWDERS™ athlete [James DeGale](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/bulkpowders-james-degale-formalise-partnership/) is back in action on November 28th, making the first defence of his IBF Super Middleweight World Title against Canada’s Lucian Bute. Bute is a former IBF champion, who successfully defended his title nine times before losing to Carl Froch in Nottingham. This time, Bute will have home advantage with the fight taking place in Quebec City, Canada.

James goes into the fight full of confidence having won the title against American Andre Dirrell in Boston, USA. James knocked Dirrell down twice on the way to a unanimous points decision. In his previous two fights, James’ knocked out both highly ranked Mexican Marco Antonio Periban and American Brandon Gonzales. Asked about fighting Bute in Canada, James told BULK POWDERS™, “It doesn’t matter to me. Of course, I’d like to defend my belt in front of my home fans but that time will come. For now, I’ve business to take care of in Canada.”

Bute has 32 wins from 34 fights, but a confident DeGale said, “Bute is world class but I’m better. I’m faster, more skilful and I’ll be coming home with my belt.”

As always, BULK POWDERS™ will be supporting James with the highest quality sports nutrition throughout his training camp to help him perform at his best.
