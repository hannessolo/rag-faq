**Post-workout,** and in need of a quick hit of protein, carbs and some champion fats? The Muscle Baker, our very own Gibraltan Queen of the Kitchen, delivers with this **quick and easy shake**, using our [Complete Recovery](../../complete-recovery.html "Complete Recovery")™ and adding some simple, fresh ingredients to the mixer to bring things to life. Blenders at the ready…!

### Instructions

1.) In any blender add all the ingredients, in no particular order and blitz away!

2.) If you prefer it thicker, add less milk or vice versa. Alternatively, use water instead.

3.) Pour in your fancy cup, add a fancy straw and drink up!
