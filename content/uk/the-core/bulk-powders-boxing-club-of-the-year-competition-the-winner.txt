At BULK POWDERS™, we have an enormous amount of respect for local boxing clubs, and the hard work, focus and determination that goes into training the next generation of young athletes.

That’s what inspired us to launch the BULK POWDERS™ Boxing Club of the Year Competition, as a way of celebrating all the clubs that work hard to offer that winning mix of top-notch facilities, experience and knowledge – combined with a can-do attitude that encourages members to push themselves to be the best they can be.

The clubs on our [shortlist of nominees](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/bulk-powders-boxing-club-of-the-year-competition-the-finalists) all demonstrated these qualities in spades, and each one was a worthy contender for the title. However, now that the public vote is complete, we’re thrilled that the time has come to announce our champion…

### The winner: Elite Boxing, Bolton

Congratulations to [Elite Boxing](http://www.eliteboxing.co.uk) in Bolton – BULK POWDERS™ Boxing Club of the Year!

This friendly club is known for encouraging individual development through small class sizes and a one-to-one style of training. This personal touch allows every member – amateurs and professionals alike – to focus on their own goals and technique, while still benefitting from the team spirit and friendly competition that comes with training with others.

As testament to the high quality of their coaching, Elite Boxing have produced some truly great fighters over the years – including most recently Luke Blackledge, winner of the super middleweight competition at the 2015 Commonwealth Games, and 21 year old Jack Flatley, currently undefeated in his professional career.

Elite Boxing will receive a selection of our [Pro Series™ products](../../shop-by-range/pro-series.html), plus BULK POWDERS™ shakers, T-shirts and an exclusive club discount to help their members stay on top of their game.

### **The runner-up: Miguel’s Boxing Gym**

We’d also like to give a special shout-out to our runner-up, [Miguel’s Boxing Gym](http://www.miguelsboxinggym.co.uk/) in Brixton, London.

This clean, modern gym is universally acclaimed for its welcoming atmosphere and inclusive approach, providing a high level of professional and amateur training in a relaxed, community setting. Widely known as “the friendliest gym in London”, Miguel’s is also praised for its inspirational staff, who go out of their way to give every member the best experience possible.

Congratulations and massive thanks as well to all the clubs which took part, and to everyone who took the time to nominate and vote for their favourites! It’s been really inspiring to hear all the support and appreciation that’s out there for these hard-working boxing clubs.
