If you haven’t heard about the wonders of Maca Powder, where the devil have you been hiding? Rubbing shoulders with the other ‘superfoods’, Maca Powder is well regarded amongst nutritionists due to its notable nutritional properties – a rich essential amino acid profile, low GI carbs, and an abundance of vitamins and minerals.

But what makes Maca Powder so good? Here are just 3 great reasons to try Maca Powder.

### **Brimming with important vitamins and minerals.**

It contains 3 times more [Vitamin C](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitamin-c-tablets-1000mg/bpb-vitc-t000) than an orange, and 5 times more iron than spinach. That’s a pretty significant amount of goodness right there. Consider that it also contains twice as much calcium as milk and you start to see the bigger picture.

### **It’s a low GI source of carbohydrate.**

For anyone who is looking for a slow and sustained release of energy, [Maca Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/maca-powder/bpb-maca-0000) is a great source of low GI carbohydrates. For people who want, or need, to manage their blood glucose levels, Maca is perfect. The powder is digested slowly in the body, giving a continuous release of energy throughout the day – without any rapid blood glucose spiking.

### **It’s a superb source of protein.**

With over 12g of protein per 100g, it’s actually a very good source of protein – with a rich essential amino acid profile. It’s the combination of this, with vitamins and minerals like Zinc and Iron that really benefit active individuals, particularly those training for muscle hypertrophy.

### **What makes Maca Powder so special?**

Our [Maca Root Extract Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/maca-powder/bpb-maca-0000) is a 100% pure, gluten free, low GI carbohydrate source. With high levels of protein, fibre and vitamins and minerals, it really is a supplement powerhouse, and a brilliant alternative to other carbohydrate sources for athletes to use during training and competition.

It’s extremely versatile too – great when added in smoothies, juices or in your favourite protein shake. Add it to your basket today!
