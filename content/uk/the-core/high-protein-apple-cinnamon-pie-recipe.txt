Here’s a simple recipe for **High Protein Apple Cinnamon Pie**, a combination of delightful sweet and savoury, with apple providing the sweetness and cinnamon complementing the flavours perfectly. At 10g protein and only 4g carbs per slice, it’d be rude not to try it for yourself!

### Instructions:

1.) Mix up all of your ingredients, except for the apple.

2.) Combine your mixture and make sure you add in enough cinnamon.

3.) Cut up half of the apple into little chunks, which you then add to your cake batter.

4.) Mix until you have a smooth texture and the dough takes on a thicker consistency.

5.) Now slice the other half of your apple and place the slices on top of the pie. Sprinkle a little extra cinnamon over the pie (to taste), then bake it for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat.

An overwhelming, delicious smell of cinnamon apples will alert you when the pie is ready! Enjoy!
