Protein is an essential macronutrient for muscle growth and repair. Protein should be consumed primarily through food sources. Check out our guide on [30 great food sources of protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/30-great-food-sources-of-protein/). Supplements can be used as just that – a supplement, to make sure you are consuming enough protein on a daily basis to meet your requirements.

For some people it can be difficult to consume enough protein, especially if you spend a lot of time travelling and on the go. In this article we will be taking a look at some of the best and most convenient ways to consume protein on the go.

**How much protein do you need?**
---------------------------------

Before you begin to plan what you need to eat to get enough protein, you first need to work out how much protein you personally should eat to support muscle growth.

The general rule is to ensure you are eating 2g of protein per kilogram of your bodyweight. This means, if you weigh 80kg for example, you should be looking to consume around 160g of protein on a daily basis. Once you know your protein goal, you may find you need some extra help from supplements and protein snacks to ensure you meet it.

**5 items you need for on-the-go protein**
------------------------------------------

### **1.) High Protein Snack Bars**

These ultra-convenient high protein snack bars will deliver an amazing 27g of high quality protein per bar. When you are on the go, you may not always have the time to sit down and eat a full meal. The BULK POWDERS® [High Protein Snack Bar](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-protein-snack-bars-box-of-12.html) is a great way to consume a large amount of protein. The bar is very low in carbohydrates, with just 1.7g of carbs per bar, making it an ideal high protein snack if you are looking to build lean muscle.

This protein bar is available in three great flavours including chocolate praline, strawberries & cream, and chocolate orange, so you can choose the one that suits you.

### **2.) Pure Whey Protein****™**

When you are on the go, protein powder can be a great source of protein. [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html) provides outstanding value for money and also comes in a variety of different sized packets. When travelling, you could make use of the 500g bags. They take up very little room in your bag and can provide you with a source of high quality protein when you need it.

Pure Whey Protein™ is low in fat and carbohydrates, and is also rich in BCAAs, which are essential amino acids for muscle growth.

Choose from a selection of great flavours including chocolate, strawberry, banana, vanilla, raspberry and many more.

### **3.) Pro Series****™** **Storage Shaker****™**

The [Pro Series**™** Storage Shaker**™**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pro-series-storage-shaker-600ml.html) is fitted with two convenient storage compartments, which simply screw to the bottom of the shaker.

These storage compartments allow you to take powdered supplements such as whey protein with you on the go, as well as tablets and capsules. This allows you to prepare for the day ahead and have all your supplements in one place. The shaker can contain 600ml of liquid, meaning it can double-up as a water bottle to keep you hydrated whilst you are out and about.

### **4.) High Protein Flapjacks**

High protein snacks can be one of the most convenient sources of protein. They are easy to store, have a long use by date, and are quick to consume. [High protein flapjacks](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-protein-flapjacks.html) are packed with 21g of high quality protein, are high in fibre and also contain almost 40g of slow releasing carbohydrates sourced from oats.

Carbohydrates are an important energy source, making them a great snack for fighting fatigue if you spend a lot of time travelling. These flapjacks are available in two great flavours: strawberry yoghurt and double chocolate. They are also suitable for vegetarians.

### **5.) Protein Porridge Pots**

Hotel breakfasts can be great, but sometimes they can have limited healthy options or the time of serving just doesn’t fit into your morning routine. Luckily there is a solution to make sure you do not leave your hotel room without having eaten a healthy, nutritious breakfast to give you the best possible start to the day.

BULK POWDERS® [Protein Porridge Pots](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein-porridge-pots.html) provide a high protein breakfast snack. They contain 23g of protein and under 3g of sugar.
