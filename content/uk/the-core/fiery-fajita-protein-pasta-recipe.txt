A spicy blend of paprika, chilli and tomato with your favourite fajita toppings made with our very own High Protein Pasta – a recipe that will put the whole “Pasta is evil” claim to rest!

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.) Bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil and add the High Protein Pasta (you can also add salt at this stage but I didn’t and it made no obvious difference). For Al Dente pasta, cook for about 5 minutes. If you prefer softer pasta shapes, cook for up to 10 minutes (any longer and the pasta will become sticky).

2.) Drain the water and allow the pasta to firm up a bit in the pot while you prepare spicy vegetables.

3.) Heat a frying pan over medium heat and spray with non-stick spray (or use some oil of choice). Add the peppers, onions, spices and lemon juice. Saute until the vegetables have softened and the peppers have “blackened” slightly around the edges – about ten minutes.

4.) Add the tomatoes and cook for another two minutes. Tomatoes soften quickly so be careful they don’t burn and stick to the pan.

5.) Add the cooked pasta and cook over low heat for another 2 minutes to allow the flavours to combine and the pasta is well coated in the spice mix.

6.) Serve and top with the Greek yogurt, avocado and salsa (if using).

Enjoy!
