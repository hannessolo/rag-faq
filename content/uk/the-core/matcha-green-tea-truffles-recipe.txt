According to a report by The Sun (so it obviously must be true), a rogue group of activists recently broke into a research facility at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva. It’s not known exactly what they were doing, but what is suggested is that our very own Muscle Baker had already been there. Besides a few vibrations and some residual heat, nothing appeared out of the ‘norm’, at first.

The only anomoly was a cluster of **Matcha Green Tea Truffles** neatly stacked against a section of the LHC. When approached, The Muscle Baker declined to comment. Conspiracy theorists proclaim that she has found a way to enhance protein bioavailability in truffles by experimenting with the famous particle accelerator…

All we know is that she makes tasty, high protein recipes and may, or may not, be related to the The Flash.

### Instructions:

1.) Mix all the ingredients (except for dark chocolate) in a bowl, in no particular order.

2.) Roll into balls and place on a lined baking tray or plate.

3.) Place in freezer for an hour or so for them to harden.

4.) Melt chocolate in microwave or in a glass bowl over boiling water and coat your matcha balls.

5.) Sprinkle with topping you desire, we used pumpkin seeds (to keep the green theme colour going).
