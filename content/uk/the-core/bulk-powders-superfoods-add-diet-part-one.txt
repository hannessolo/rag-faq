Superfoods and their health benefits as part of a well balanced diet
--------------------------------------------------------------------

‘Superfoods’ are classed as being nutrient-rich foods that are ‘especially beneficial for health and well-being’. Although the addition of a few ‘superfoods’ can’t compensate for the effects of an unhealthy diet, if your diet is well balanced and providing all the nutrients you need, no doubt it will include several of the foods below.

In part one of this series we take a look at the first part of the alphabet, so to discover which ‘superfoods’ have made our list and what health benefits they can offer to a well-rounded and healthy diet, read on!

### Avocado

Avocados are one of nature’s best sources of healthy fats. Most of the fat found in an avocado is monounsaturated fat, i.e the ‘good fat’. Avocados have one of the highest protein levels of all fruits, with around 4g of protein in an average sized avocado. They also contain around 11g of fibre (recommended intake is 18g per day) and are a good source of vitamins K, B6, C and E, and potassium.

### Broccoli

Packed full of immune system boosting vitamin C, dietary fibre, and vitamin A, broccoli is also a good source of potassium. Broccoli also contains compounds thought to offer antiviral, antibacterial and cancer preventing activity in the immune response system. BULK POWDERS™ [Broccoli Powder](../../broccoli-powder.html "Broccoli Powder") delivers all the benefits of broccoli but in a super-concentrated powder form that you can easily add to a morning smoothie or use in cooking.

### Carrots

Carrots, as shown by their bright orange colour, are high in the antioxidant beta-carotene. As an antioxidant, beta-carotene protects the body from free radicals.

Beta-carotene is absorbed in the intestine and converted into vitamin A during digestion, which is an essential nutrient. Carrots also contain fibre, vitamin K, potassium, vitamin E and zinc.

### Dried Apricots

Vitamins A and C, potassium and high levels of dietary fibre are all found in apricots. Although the drying process can remove some of the water soluble and heat sensitive nutrients of fruits, it causes other nutrients to become more concentrated. Because of this, BULK POWDERS™ [Dried Whole Apricots](../../dried-whole-apricots.html "Dried Apricots") actually provide higher levels of most nutrients than a fresh apricot would.

### Eggs

Regardless of whether you consume the [yolk](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/why-choose-bulk-powders-liquid-egg-whites/ "Eating the egg yolk") or the white of the egg, both contain some important nutrients. But eggs whites like our Active Foods™ [Liquid Egg Whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html "Liquid Egg Whites") are rich in protein, vitamins and minerals but without the cholesterol found in the yolk. Egg whites contain over half of the total protein found in an egg plus vitamins B2, D, B6, B12, and zinc, iron and copper, but with less calories than the yolk. Eggs also contain all eight essential amino acids.

### Flaxseed

Also known as linseed, flaxseed contains linolenic acid which is an omega-3 essential fatty acid and is a vital nutrient for maintaining and improving health. It also contains lignans which have antioxidant qualities, and is a source of both soluble and insoluble fibre. BULK POWDERS™ [Flaxseed Powder](../../flaxseed-powder.html "Flaxseed Powder") is a free-flowing powder form of natural flaxseed oil.

### Garlic

From helping with impotency and reducing cholesterol, to fighting infections and aiding in cancer prevention, garlic has long been hailed as a ‘wonder food’.

Garlic contains high doses of vitamins C and B6 which help to strengthen the immune system. Garlic also regulates blood sugar as it enhances the level of insulin found in the blood.

A garlic supplement, such as BULK POWDERS™ [Garlic Extract Tablets](../../garlic-extract-tablets-1000mg.html "Garlic Tablets"), can help keep the pungent aroma down as the tablets are enteric coated. This ensures the odour is kept well under control.

Another plus of taking garlic in a concentrated tablet form is the strength. You’d need to eat around 28 cloves a day to get all the researched benefits of garlic. But just one BULK POWDERS™ Garlic Extract Tablet is equivalent to a huge 1,000mg garlic.
