Get ready for the 31st October with this Frankenstein Crispy Pops Halloween Recipe. Spooky and full of protein, these will go down a treat at your Halloween party.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.) In a bowl, whisk together agave and VitaFiber™ powder, then microwave for 30 seconds, whisk and microwave another 30 seconds. The idea is that you want the VitaFiber™ fully dissolved into the agave nectar. You can also do this in a saucepan, would you prefer to not use a microwave. You just need to apply the same principles and whisk until all dissolved.

2.) Grab a bowl, fold in peanut butter first to make a paste, then fold in the remaining ingredients until you get a thick mouldable consistency.

3.) Press your mix into a desired pan or mould. If using a non-silicone mould, make sure to line your pan with greaseproof paper.

Note: We used a square silicone mould.

4.) Freeze overnight, or until mixture is solid enough to remove. Once removed, slice into rectangle shapes, place ice-cream sticks carefully and place back in freezer.

5.) Melt chocolate, remove your rectangle pops and begin dipping them, coating about 1/3 of the top.

6.) Place on a lined tray and decorate with chocolate sprinkles, pressing white choc buttons onto edge of melts chocolate to create ‘eye’ placers. To finish off grab a sharp knife, dip the edge into melted chocolate and dollop onto white choc buttons to finish the eyes. Then, swipe/scribble roughly with the edge of the knife to create the ‘mouth’.
