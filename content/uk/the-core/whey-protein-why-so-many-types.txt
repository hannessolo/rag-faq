Looking for a protein supplement? Well most people would steer you in the direction of a [Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein.html) supplement. However, for many who are new to sports nutrition and don’t know where to start this could be equally as confusing with a range of products each having a unique selling point. Now, where do you start?

Let me begin by saying, there is a reason for all the types of Whey Protein we sell – each and every product is aimed at offering a version that suits you. But before we get ahead of ourselves, what is whey protein? Whey Protein is a protein found originally in milk. Milk contains two types of protein Whey and Casein. The reason why Whey is often more sought after is due to its rapid digestion, impressive amino acid profile, being rich in BCAA and Glutamine, and is a very smooth, tasty drink (compared to other proteins).

Now, onto the products…

Let’s start with the most popular – [Pure Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html)™… this is our most basic, pure whey protein concentrate supplement which offers 82% protein, and is available in over 20 different flavours. This is the best value for money and perhaps the most versatile Whey Protein product we sell.

[Pure Whey Isolate™ 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-isolate-90.html) is another great [Pure Series™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/pure-series.html) Whey protein product like Pure Whey Protein™, however this is a pure whey protein isolate product. Whey Protein Isolate is higher in protein at 90%, whilst also being lower in carbohydrates and fat. For some, this is ideal for a dieting phase where lowering carbohydrates and/or fats is the ideal scenario. With over 10 different flavours, this is another easy to use product.

[INFORMED WHEY®](https://www.bulk.com/uk/informed-whey.html) is our most premium Whey Protein supplement, combining Whey Protein Isolate, with Whey Protein Concentrate in one product. This also has other layers to it, making it more and more premium, such as added Leucine, Glutamine, Digestive Enzymes (DigeZyme®) and Probiotics (LactoSpore®). Furthermore, this product is batch tested as part of the Informed Sport program.

[Pure Whey Isolate™ 97](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-isolate-97.html) an ultra-pure Whey Protein Isolate. Like Pure Whey Isolate™ 90, but even lower in carbohydrates and fat (virtually free) and 97% protein. Pure Whey Isolate™ 97 is also completely free from instantizing agents such as Soya Lecithin or Sunflower Lecithin… just pure protein.

[Natural Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/natural-pure-whey-protein.html) is exactly the same protein source as Pure Whey Protein™, just naturally flavoured, coloured and sweetened with Stevia. Likewise with [Natural Pure Whey Isolate™ 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/natural-pure-whey-isolate-90.html), this takes the same high quality whey protein isolate as our Pure Whey Isolate™ 90 just naturally flavoured, coloured and sweetened with Stevia.

[Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/hydrolysed-whey-protein-isolate.html) is a lesser known whey protein supplement. This is like taking our pure whey protein isolate and breaking down the proteins into smaller chunks. By doing this, you are almost having a slightly pre-digested whey protein – so when you consume it is digested even more quickly! Perfect if you want to use a protein supplement right before the gym.

[Organic Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-pure-whey-protein.html) takes the principles of Pure Whey Protein™, being an pure whey protein concentrate, but ensures it is sourced from Organically certified milk/cheese and is processed to the stringent Organic standards of the Soil Association.

With the above breakdown of our Whey Protein products in one place, I hope this might help you to make the best decision on a product that suits you specifically. Gone are the days of you looking through countless articles on each type of whey protein, or looking at each product with a dazed look on your face – simply pick and click.
