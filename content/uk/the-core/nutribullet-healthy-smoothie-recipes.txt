You’d be hard-pressed to find an owner of a blitzer, blender or juicer who hasn’t heard of the NutriBullet. Even those of us who still chew our food are familiar with the product and its ever-growing online community.

The NutriBullet and Magic Bullet brands have sold over 30 million units worldwide. John Lewis rank the product as one of its most popular gifts after selling the gadget at a rate of one unit every 30 seconds on Black Friday. It’s clear that the NutriBullet and the NutriBullet Recipes have rapidly become one of the nation’s most popular kitchen staples.

For those who are unaccustomed to the latest gadget craze, the NutriBullet completely pulverises fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds right down to the molecular level, which is said to aid digestion and absorption of beneficial super nutrients. It’s this totally unique process that makes the NutriBullet such a popular blender… I mean ‘extractor’. Another popular blender is the Breville Blend-Active® that also does a cracking job and is one of Amazon’s best sellers in the category.

Maybe you’re fascinated by the science, maybe you’re a self-confessed smoothie fanatic, or perhaps you’re just trying to get more fruit and veg into your diet. Either way, we’ve put together some amazing healthy smoothie recipes for you to try using your chosen kitchen appliance. Each recipe uses a selection of BULK POWDERS™ products, carefully selected to deliver an abundance of protein, carbs, fibre, vitamins, minerals and healthy fats.
