On Saturday night, in front of a packed Wembley Stadium, BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale knocked out previously unbeaten American Brandon Gonzales in the 4th round. James is now the mandatory challenger for the IBF Title, successfully defended by Carl Froch in the top of the bill clash against George Groves.

The majority of the pre-fight build up had focussed on the strength of Gonzales in the early rounds – many suggested for James to win, he’d need to come on strong late in the fight to take advantage of Gonzales’ lack of experience over 12 rounds. Instead, James intentionally came out fast and it was immediately apparent that his speed, movement and timing were causing Gonzales a lot of problems – the fast start wasn’t what the American expected. Asked about his start, James said, “That was part of the plan my trainer Jim and I came up with – we knew that was something he wouldn’t expect.”

Gonzales looked to settle a little in rounds 2 & 3, but James was regularly landing clean shots on his opponent.

In the 4th round, James continued accuracy frequently troubled Gonzales. Many expected James to keep Gonzales on the end of his jab, but James was also comfortable fighting Gonzales on the inside – the key moment in the fight started with James working on the inside. A 5 punch combination to body and head backed up Gonzales and James took advantage with a huge left hook to Gonzales’ chin which put him on the canvas. The fight was called off shortly after with the referee deciding that the American was in no position to continue.

Asked about his decision to fight on the inside James said, “Again, Jim and I knew that he wouldn’t expect me to hang around up close. I was comfortable and felt I was stronger.”

In the post-fight interview and press-conference, James expressed his desire to fight Carl Froch. James’ respectfully commented that it was “Froch’s night”, so didn’t comment too specifically, aside from saying he believes he has the attributes to give Froch problems. James also gave a shout out to BULK POWDERS™, which was great to see!
