In case you missed it, we’ve just launched our very own [**Chia Seed Muffin Mix**](../../chia-seed-muffin-mix.html)™. As part of our [**ACTIVE FOODS**](../../shop-by-range/active-foods.html)™ range, this new Chia mix is about to make your lives in the kitchen a whole lot easier! Packing in all the key ingredients for delicious home-baked muffins, these Chia Seed Muffins are super easy to make and can be prepared and baked in just 30 minutes. Baking has never been so simple!

High in protein (12 muffins contain a massive 65g protein), we’ve added Coconut Flour and Flaxseed Powder to the mix for added fibre and flavour. The protein content is derived from a combination of Whey Protein, Milk Protein and Egg Protein, all of which contribute to the growth and maintenance of muscle mass.
