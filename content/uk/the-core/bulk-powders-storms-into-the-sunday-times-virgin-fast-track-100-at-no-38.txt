**Bulk™**, the Colchester based sports nutrition brand, has delivered another fantastic year of growth to enter this year’s “[The Sunday Times Virgin Fast Track 100](http://www.fasttrack.co.uk/)” at No 38. The company, whose strap line is “performance delivered” has once again lived up to its promise.

“It’s a fantastic achievement.” says Adam Rossiter, Managing Director. “This validates a lot of hard work by a lot of talented people.”

**Bulk™** has come a long way since it was founded by Adam Rossiter and Elliot Dawes whilst they were undergraduates.

“We simply got tired of over-paying for sports supplements,” says Elliot. “We became determined to make the same kind of products without sacrificing quality. And by selling direct to the consumer we could sell high quality at low prices.”

And this has clearly resonated with their loyal and growing customer base. The company expects to reach sales of £24m in 2016.

“This is just the start of the journey,” says Rossiter. “We’re selling in 13 countries. And we’re broadening the base – sports nutrition is part of a much larger health and wellness continuum and we’re gaining traction across a much wider range of products.”
