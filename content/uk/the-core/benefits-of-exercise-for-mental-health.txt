Be it a positive coping mechanism, a purpose-giving distraction or a social hobby that creates meaningful connections, exercise has mental health benefits that extend physiologically and beyond. Exercise has something to offer everyone. And whether the aim is to help reduce anxiety, depression and negative moods, or improve self-esteem and cognitive function, there are clear correlations between increased exercise and better mental health \[[**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mental%20health%20by,self%2Desteem%20and%20cognitive%20function.&text=Exercise%20has%20also%20been%20found,self%2Desteem%20and%20social%20withdrawal.)\] \[[**2**](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/exercise-for-depression/)\] \[[**3**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15518309/)\].  

The [**World Health Organisation**](http://www.who.int/mental_health/world-mental-health-day/en/) recognises World Mental Health Day on 10 October every year, with a mission to ensure that mental health is treated on par with physical. In this article, we the numerous effects of some types of [exercises for mental health](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/best-exercises-for-mental-health/?preview_id=21114&preview_nonce=e39fca322b&_thumbnail_id=21117&preview=true), showing how not only does it help with our physical fitness, but our mental wellness too. Let’s dive into it.

**Promotes better sleep**
-------------------------

It will come as no surprise that sleep is essential. The mental and physical [**benefits of sleep**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/5-benefits-of-a-better-nights-sleep/) are unquestionable. Sleep helps you recover and recharge, and keeps your systems ticking along. Whether it’s resting your brain or rejuvenating your muscles rejuvenated, sleep is the key to it all.

Better sleep is linked to better mental health, and more exercise is linked to better sleep. A continuous positive cycle. As you improve one, the other improves too. It’s a harmonious loop 

If you struggle to get shut-eye, take a look at our article on [**tips to improve sleep**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/natural-sleep-aids-great-sleep/). This one focuses on diet and supplements, but it could provide some information you’ve not heard about before. 

**Creates happier moods**
-------------------------

The NHS states ‘Regular exercise can boost your mood if you have depression, and it’s especially useful for people with mild to moderate depression’ \[[**2**](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/exercise-for-depression/)\]. 

And they’re not the only ones. Whether it be a run, swim, cycle or walk, multiple studies suggest that performing regular cardio-vascular exercises reduces anxiety and depression \[[**3**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15518309/)\]. These improvements in mood were explained by the endorphin and monoamine hypotheses \[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC474733/#:~:text=The%20endorphin%20hypothesis%20predicts%20that,enhanced%20sense%20of%20well%2Dbeing.)\] (, but are also caused by an exercise-induced increase in blood circulation to the brain.

Runners often refer to the runner’s high. And it’s not just some strange thing that is actually a burning pain in your legs or lactic acid pouring into your muscles. When running, your body releases endorphins to induce a natural, euphoric high. This can have lasting effects throughout the day, giving you that subtle, buzzy feeling. 

**Helps manage stress and anxiety**
-----------------------------------

Being physically active also gives your brain something to focus on and can be a positive coping mechanism for difficult times. With a brain filled with thoughts, exerting yourself physically can help clear things out. You can feel a sense of calm and clarity as a result. Similar to how mindfulness meditation directs you to focus on your breath, exercise forces you to focus on your running stride, your teammates on the field or your next rep in the gym. It’s about focussing your attention on the present moment. 

Author Bella Mackie gives a practical example of this effect in her memoir, [**Jog On**](https://www.waterstones.com/book/jog-on/bella-mackie/9780008241728), explaining with unfiltered honesty how she used running to battle her severe anxiety and depression. She writes, “Running is not magic beans and I now know that I can’t expect it to inure me to the genuine sadness of life. But throughout tough periods in my life, and without realising it, I had finally acquired a coping skill, one that has helped me every day since I found myself on that floor, wondering how I’d ever get up. It’s not an exaggeration to say that I ran myself out of misery.”

**Improves self-confidence**
----------------------------

Exercise has also been found to alleviate low self-esteem and social withdrawal. Multiple hypotheses explain the beneficial effects of physical activity on mental health including self-efficacy, self-confidence and social interaction \[[**3**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15518309/)\].

From losing fat, increasing strength and growing muscle, there’s no shortage of physical achievements that come about from regular exercise. Although it’s not advised to have aesthetics as the sole motivation for gym and fitness, it’s a happy side effect for many people. It’s important, however, to be aware of an unhealthy or obsessive mindse. There is a balance to consider which we will discuss later.

**Increases self-efficacy**
---------------------------

Self-efficacy is the confidence in the ability to exert control over one’s own motivation, behaviour and social environment. In regards to mental health, the self-efficacy hypothesis proposes that since physical exercise is a challenging activity, the ability to get involved in it in a regular manner leads to improved mood and self-confidence \[[**3**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15518309/)\].

Whether it’s chasing a sub-30 minute 5k or a 100kg bench press, the rewards from having a solid goal to work towards are profound. Achieving goals related to fitness gives you the confidence to apply a similar goal-searching element to other parts of your life.

**Builds connections with others**
----------------------------------

The social relationships commonly inherent in physical activity, as well as the mutual support that occurs among individuals involved in the exercise, play an important role in the effects of exercise on mental health \[[**3**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15518309/)\]. There’s a priceless sense of togetherness that comes with joining a sports team, running club or making gym buddies. Given our innate inclination for belonging, feeling part of a community has a powerful effect on self-esteem.

**Being aware of exercise-induced mental health problems** 
-----------------------------------------------------------

Although exercise is mostly positive when it comes to mental health, there are some circumstances to be aware of.

With the consistent and routine aspect of exercise, some people may experience compulsive or addictive feelings around physical activity (sometimes called exercise addiction). There’s also the tangible regard, whether it be muscle mass, goal achievement or endorphin hits. An addiction to these sensations can lead to harmful overtraining or increased stress.
