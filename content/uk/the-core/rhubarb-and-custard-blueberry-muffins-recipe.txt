Some say Wedgewood have made a customised dinner plate for him because no other plate is big enough and that he sings Irish folk songs whilst breaking records for the number of Chocolate Whey Balls™ he can fit in his mouth. All we know is, he’s called The Beltsander.

With BULK POWDERS™ Rhubarb & Custard Pure Whey Protein™, Coconut Flour and VitaFiber™ Powder, the man, the legend, has made a masterpiece. If he entered the Great British Bake Off, there is no doubt he would win. Give this delightful protein muffin recipe a try.

**Instructions:**

1.) Preheat the oven to 210° (high starting temperature helps them to rise)

2.) In a bowl mix the dry ingredients

3.) Add the egg whites and almond milk and mix

4.) Add the blueberries to the mix and carefully pour them into 8 muffin cases

5.) Put them in the oven and turn the temperature down to 160° and bake for 20 minutes or until golden
