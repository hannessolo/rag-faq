### Summary:

Kick off your day with a spinach & blueberry pancake that will knock your socks off!  Turbo charged with over 40g of protein and maca-powdered slow release carbohydrates, you’ll be ready to take on the world!

### Instructions:

1.) In a saucepan, heat up your frozen blueberries, water and sweetener until simmering. Then, leave simmering on low heat until your pancakes are done. You’ll know your blueberry compote is ready when all the liquid has been soaked up and only a bit of sauce is left.

2.) Add all the remaining ingredients to a blender, blitz until all smooth, and proceed to start making your pancakes on a non-stick pan, on medium heat.

3.) I prefer using the coconut oil to make them, I don’t add it all at once, rather adding tiny bits as I go making the pancakes.

4.) Once they’re all done (should be a total of 10 pancakes, 5 per serving) stack them up and drizzle your blueberry sauce over it.

5.) They were really tasty, filling and had all the nutrients one needs to start the day right!

\*If a different sweetener is used, your macros may vary.
