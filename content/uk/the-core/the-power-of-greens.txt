Everyone rants and raves about green powders and superfoods, and whilst some of this is sometimes blown out of proportion, there is definitely merit in a nutrient dense supplement like [Complete Greens](../../complete-greens.html)™ to support a healthy, and often busy, lifestyle.

Many of us aren’t getting the nutrients we need from our diet. This can be for any number of reasons, but often cost and time are the main contributing factors.

The cost of fresh supermarket produce to replicate recommended RDA’s can quickly become expensive. Then there is the time it takes to prepare – and not to mention the tendency for fresh produce to perish very quickly, often leading to a lot of wasted food and money.

And that’s where we come in.

**Why use a Greens powder?**
----------------------------

**Complete Greens**™ contains some ingredients that you will have heard of and may already consume in your current diet; however, some are unique additions to ensure that **Complete Greens**™ stands apart from other greens formulas on the market today.

**Complete Greens**™ has been formulated with close attention paid to the ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) scale; ensuring we have included some of the highest rated foods available.

### **What does this mean?**

It means that **Complete Greens**™ is packed full of green goodness, ensuring that you’re getting an abundance of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids and fibre to support your active lifestyle. And not just that, you’re getting the sort of nutrient quantities that actually make a difference, contributing to more than 5 of your 5-a-day.

A 500g bag contains 55 servings and can be stored conveniently in your kitchen, at work or in your gym bag, with a shelf life of well over 12 months.

### **Not for everyone.**

**Complete Greens**™ is a super greens powder offered in its absolute purest form: pure greens with no fillers or large amounts of flavouring. If increasing your nutrient intake is important to you, this is a fantastic product. But **Complete Greens**™ isn’t for everyone. Not everyone likes vegetables. Not everyone rejoices at the sight of kale and broccoli.

### **Introducing Complete Greens Protein Smoothie™**

[Complete Greens Protein Smoothie](../../complete-greens-protein-smoothie.html)™ has been developed for that very reason. It is an alternative greens supplement for people who struggle with the taste of **Complete Greens**™ in its purest form.

If you are looking for a high protein smoothie which is bursting with nutrients and flavour, then **Complete Greens Protein Smoothie**™ is perfect. This high protein, fruit smoothie is packed with flavour and goodness. As the name suggests, not only does it provide 20g of protein per serving, but it also delivers 4g of the nutrient-dense super greens blend, **Complete Greens**™, providing a range of vitamins and minerals.

With the addition of Bee Pollen powder, Coconut Flour, Blueberry Powder and Pieces, plus Stevia Extract to add a bit of natural sweetness, it offers a smoother taste – with the benefit of protein too. Double win.

**Go green and get healthy!**
