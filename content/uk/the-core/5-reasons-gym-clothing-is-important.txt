After seeing a massive upturn in popularity over the pandemic, more and more people have taken a firm interest in [**gym clothing**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/accessories-clothing/gym-clothing). Here we share five reasons why gearing yourself up with well-designed activewear could be beneficial for your motivation, confidence and performance.

**1\. Helps with motivation and confidence**
--------------------------------------------

In comfortable and flattering clothing, making the trip to the gym becomes a much more appealing prospect. Feeling confident in your clothing helps bring out the side of you that wants to be there and is ready to perform. Instead of walking into the gym, you strut.

For many people, the hardest part of a consistent gym programme is just that — showing up. Once you’re through the doors and in the groove of your workout, the time moves quickly and you enjoy it. But actually getting yourself out the door can be a problem, particularly if it’s first thing in the morning or after a gruelling day at work. Putting on gym clothes can help engage your mindset into workout mode and instil excitement and anticipation at the potential for the session ahead. In other words, gym clothes can act as a great motivator.

Whether it’s performance clothing, oversized graphic tees or even some retro eighties leg warmers (you do you), step into your favourite gym wear and get down there. But please, no jeans. Never, ever jeans.

**2\. Gets you in the zone**
----------------------------

Similar to motivating you to leave for the gym, the right gym clothing can get you in the zone when you’re _inside_ the gym. You know that unique feeling of slipping into your favourite [**gym shirt or vest**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/accessories-clothing/t-shirts-tops). You’re ready for battle. Ready to glide into the gym and conquer your workout. Your confidence is boosted and no matter what weight you load onto the bar, what speed you notch up on the treadmill, or that extra squat your PT insists you give them, you know you can smash through it. You become a superhero.

Believe it or not, the idea that clothing can change your mindset in order to affect performance has actually been investigated by scientists. There’s a psychological phenomenon called ‘enclothed cognition’ \[[**1**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103112000200)\], which suggests that the clothing you wear can trigger mental changes that affect performance and confidence levels. So, whether you prefer your gym gear sculpted to your muscles like a second skin, or loosely billowing over your biceps, suit up with the knowledge that when you feel good, those gains will feel much more achievable.

Don’t believe us? Let us set the scene.

You’re in the gym, you’re lining yourself up for that next big lift or press. You’re going for a PB, maybe you’re even filming it. It’s a big lift, one you’ve been leading up to for weeks. Now imagine you’re wearing a pair of tatty jeans and that t-shirt you’ve been sleeping in since your teens. You’re tentative as you approach the bar. Are you going to smash this PB? Unlikely.

Now, let’s reimagine the scene where we change one simple thing – your clothing. This time you’re wearing your favourite gym outfit. And you feel different, you feel capable, and most of all, you feel _strong_. You’re chalked up, hyped up and ready to go. As you approach the platform, fire roars in your belly. You wrap your hands around the bar, and it becomes part of your soul. You brace, squeeze, and rip it up with ease.

**3\. You can feel free and unrestricted** 
-------------------------------------------

Alongside the mindset aspect of gym clothing, lightweight materials and intelligent fabric mean your gym wear feels like a second skin, ensuring you don’t feel restricted while you train. Exercising in total comfort can allow you to solely concentrate on the task at hand, and workout to the best of your ability. 

Some movements require your clothing to be flexible and easy, so choosing clothing that allows full range of movement is important. If you’re doing squats or [**squat variations**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/7-squat-variations-need-try/), your shorts need to move with you and stretch as your leg muscles contract.

Likewise, some movements prefer more breathable fabrics, others less so. This is especially important for endurance activities like running, where the material is bouncing around a lot against your bare skin. You need the fabric to be suitable. 

**4\. Helps regulate body temperature**
---------------------------------------

Working out means sweating is inevitable. And it’s encouraged, as sweat can be a sign of a good, hard session. Saying that, it can be pretty irritating if you start feeling weighed down or uncomfortable. There’s a reason gym shirts aren’t made of cotton. Cotton absorbs sweat and retains moisture. Your body is locked in and sweat can’t escape, leaving you feeling damp and heavy. Not a great motivator. Not a great level of comfort.

Instead, opting for light, breathable and intelligent fabrics can help regulate and maintain your body temperature to ensure you can perform at your best in the ultimate comfort. This allows sweat to evaporate and make room for more.

**5\. Athleisure is a growing style**
-------------------------------------

Athleisure is the fashion movement that all gym junkies have been waiting for. And with designer athleisure brands like [**Cole Buxton**](https://www.colebuxton.com/) popping up, as well as the ever-increasing influence of casualwear by Gymshark, the free-flowing, juxtaposition of casual and active is here to stay.

Clothing is a way to empower and express yourself in everyday life. Everyone has the ability to curate their own style, and expressing your passion for fitness alongside the desire to ‘look good’ is possible. 

And it’s also practical. Whether it’s morning lateness speed-walking, lunchtime gym escapades or post-work battles with barbells, you’re covered for every active scenario.
