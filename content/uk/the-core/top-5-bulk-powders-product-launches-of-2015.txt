Here at BULK POWDERS™ we, the Product Team, have been working hard to come up with new, innovative products which separate ourselves from the market, in terms of **quality, formulation, and flavours**. We wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the top 5 new product launches for this year.

Complete Greens Tablets 1000mg
------------------------------

**[Complete Greens™ Tablets 1000mg](../../complete-greens-tablets.html)** has been one of most popular and interesting launches this year for a number of reasons. First of all, the nutrients themselves: the greens formula is the same as our **Complete Greens™ Powder**, offering 24 nutrient dense ingredients which equate to over 5 of your 5 a day. We decided to offer Complete Greens™ in this tablet format, because we fully appreciate that the natural flavour of Greens isn’t for everyone (tablets are also very convenient). **Complete Greens Tablets 1000mg** are perfect for anyone who wants the nutritional benefits of greens, but without the flavour. Complete Greens™ Tablets 1000mg is also interesting in the way in which it is tableted – it **doesn’t contain any excipients, binders, fillers**, just pure greens, pressed into a tablet shape.

**Important product facts:**

*   100% pure super greens with no added fillers.
*   Contains 24 nutrient dense ingredients.
*   Equivalent to more than 5 of your 5-a-day.

Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free
-----------------------------------

**[Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free](../../complete-pre-workout-caffeine-free.html)** is another exciting product launch from 2015. There is an increasing number of people who are either sensitive to caffeine/stimulants and want to avoid it, or there are those who train very late in the evening, and want to avoid stimulants so they can obtain a restful night’s sleep. Don’t make any mistake, **Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free** is an exciting formulation in its own right, we haven’t simply removed out Caffeine from our Complete Pre-Workout™. We have developed a new formulation which includes some different and exciting ingredients such as, Electrolytes, Choline Bitartrate, Creatine Monohydrate, along with improved doses of Beta Alanine and Citrulline Malate.

**Important product facts:**

*   5g BCAA, including 3g Leucine.
*   Over 18g active ingredients.
*   Reduces sensations of tiredness and fatigue\*

ELEVATE™ Pre-Workout (Cherry Cola flavour)
------------------------------------------

Throughout the year we have endeavoured to offer an increasing range of flavours on our existing product ranges. This is more obvious on our Pro Series™ range of products – more specifically the innovative flavour **Cherry Cola**, which is only available on our product [**ELEVATE**](../../elevate.html)™. We wanted to develop a new, interesting flavour, which the market had never seen before to give customers a pre-workout that is enjoyable to drink, but also masks the flavour of all the high dosed ingredients within the product. In addition, we decided to develop this flavour and launch it exclusively at Body Power UK 2015 – giving everyone at the show, an opportunity to be the first people to try it.

**Important product facts:**

*   Incredible 13 potently dosed, pre-workout ingredients.
*   Banned substance tested under [**Informed Sport**](../../sports-nutrition/informed-sport.html) programme.
*   Includes Vitargo®, ActiNOS™ and BioPerine®.

SPORTS MULTI AM:PM
------------------

An advanced multivitamin and multi-mineral product was an obvious gap within our Pro Series™ range, which is why we worked hard to come up with a new, innovative and high quality product – [**SPORTS MULTI AM:PM**](../../sports-multi-am-pm-capsules.html). The formula works to provide you with a range of high quality, patented ingredients, such as **K-Pure® Minerals, Lactospore®, DigeZyme®, Opti-Zinc®** and **BioPerine®**. The dosing format for this product is also unique, moving away from the “1 a day” multivitamin, or the pack style multivitamins, which include too many tablets to consume. Instead **SPORTS MULTI AM:PM** divides the product into two servings, a morning serving, and an evening serving, with ingredients carefully selected for use at that time of day. Furthermore, **SPORTS MULTI AM:PM** is Informed Sport approved – making it perfect for any elite level athletes who are drug tested. **SPORTS MULTI AM:PM** is an exceptional formulation, which we believe is market leading – earning itself a place in our Top 5!

**Important product facts:**

*   Market leading, premium formulation with 31 vitamins & minerals.
*   Contains morning capsules (AM) and evening capsules (PM).
*   Banned substance tested under the Informed Sport programme.

Pure Whey Protein™ Coconut & Pineapple
--------------------------------------

Further to the flavour extensions we have launched this year, one in particular has stood out due to its reception amongst you, the customers. [**Pure Whey Protein™ Coconut & Pineapple**](../../pure-whey-protein.html?pid=4086) was a bit of an unorthodox product launch, for the time of year, and because of this we decided to “**bring summer back**”. As the days got shorter and the weather got more miserable this winter, we decided to release what would normally be considered a “summer flavour” to help brighten up your days, and offer you this exotic and summery flavour.

**Important product facts:**

*   Outstanding value for money.
*   Low in fat and carbohydrates.
*   Rich in Glutamine and BCAA.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of all our product launches this year, this is what we believe are our top 5 new product launches from 2015. We wanted to share with you some of the innovative and different things we do with our formulations, which make our products stand out from the crowd. We truly believe we can offer products above and beyond the competition in terms of quality, flavour and formulation – so if you haven’t tried any of these yet, give them a go in 2016. Keep an eye on the “[**New In**](../../new-products.html)” page for all our latest launches.
