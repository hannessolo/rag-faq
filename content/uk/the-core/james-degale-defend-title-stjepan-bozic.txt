BULK POWDERS™ Ambassador James DeGale continues his march toward a world title on Saturday 8th June, live on Channel 5, with a defence of his WBC Silver Belt against Stjepan Bozic at the Glow Arena, Bluewater. Bozic has previously fought for the WBA Super Middleweight Title and boasts 26 wins from 32 fights, with 17 KO’s to his name.

For DeGale, it’ll be his second fight in less than a month. Less than 2 weeks ago, he knocked out Canadian Sebastien Demers in two rounds. The Bozic fight has come at short notice; asked by BULK POWDERS™ if this is an issue, DeGale replied “not in the slightest. I’m always in the gym and I’m raring to go. All of my efforts are towards winning a world title and I’m ready to fight anyone at any time.” When BULK POWDERS™ asked DeGale about the rumours that he was prepared to step in at short notice to fight the highly rated Jean Pascal, after his fight with Lucian Bute fell through, DeGale confirmed “sure, it was mentioned and I was well up for it. Nothing came of it, but I was happy to step in.”

Tune in to Channel 5 on Saturday night to see DeGale in action!  To get the latest updates from James, his Twitter is [@jamesdegale1](https://twitter.com/jamesdegale1). BULK POWDERS can be found [here](https://twitter.com/BulkPowders).
