Have you got what it takes to be the pump king?
-----------------------------------------------

Halloween is just around the corner which means you’re probably boarding up the house in preparation for those pesky trick or treaters (or buying sweets to dish out to the devils at the door…). You might have been down the fancy dress shop for a ghoulish get together or invested in a pumpkin (or a few pumpkins so you can build an orange bodybuilder like the guy below). Just look at those striations and bulging biceps.

We want to get your creative juices flowing by taking part in our Halloween Competition that goes by the name of – ARE YOU THE PUMP KING (get it..?).

We don’t mean rip your [BULK POWDERS™ training t-shirt](../../accessories-clothing.html "Gym training t-shirt") off and show us how vascular you are. What we want is for you to buy a pumpkin, or pumpkins, and come up with a design that will blow the rest of the competition away.

### The competition details

Firstly, go and buy a pumpkin if you don’t have one already. You have until Friday so plenty of time.

We want you to get carving and come up with a pumpkin that ideally has a health/fitness theme. So you could…

**1\. Carve the whole pumpkin into the shape of a bodybuilder**  
**2\. Carve a bodybuilder into the pumpkin**  
**3\. Carve the BULK POWDERS™ logo into your pumpkin**  
**4\. Carve a message into your pumpkin – Do you even lift bro?**

Anything goes. Google image search ‘bodybuilder pumpkin’ for some more inspiration.

If you don’t want to do that, do anything with your pumpkin and submit your entry. We just want to see what you can do.

### The PUMP KING prize

The winner will be selected by us between November 3rd-4th and we’ll post up the winning entry on our social media pages. We’ll also post up everyone else’s pumpkins afterwards so you can see all the entries.

The winning PUMP KING will **win £20 of BULK Reward points** – these will be added straight into the winner’s account to use on their next shop.
