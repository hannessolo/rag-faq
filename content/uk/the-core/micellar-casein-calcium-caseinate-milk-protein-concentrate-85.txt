Micellar Casein is a slow release protein supplement. It takes its place alongside Calcium Caseinate, Milk Protein Concentrate 85, Complete Protein Blend™ and Complete Diet Protein™ Advanced inour slow release protein range.

These slow release proteins come with their own benefits and properties. Want to know what the difference is between Micellar Casein, Calcium Caseinate and [Milk Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/milk-protein)? We’ve outlined the differences below so look no further.

**MICELLAR CASEIN**
-------------------

[Micellar Casein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/micellar-casein/bpb-mpi9-0000) contains approximately 90% un-denatured protein and is a rich source of BCAAs and Glutamine. It is created when casein protein is separated from whey, fat and lactose in milk. This is the slowest digesting form of casein as it forms micelles when added to fluid.

The micelles take a long time to digest and therefore Micellar Casein is digested slower than Calcium Caseinate.

This is the ideal choice of protein shake before bed as it slowly releases amino acids over a more prolonged period of time, helping to keep your body in an anabolic state while you sleep.

Available in two great tasting flavours, Chocolate and Strawberry, which makes for a tasty [protein shake before bed](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/slow-release-protein).

**CALCIUM CASEINATE**
---------------------

Calcium Caseinate contains approximately 90% protein whilst also being a rich source of minerals and amino acids such as Glutamine. It is digested very slowly by the body therefore it can be used before bed as you slowly absorb amino acids to keep your body in an anabolic state while you sleep.

It can also be used when you have a long time between meals to provide you with a source of protein and to keep you feeling full.

Calcium Caseinate differs from Micellar Casein in the way in which it is more soluble. It is formed when an alkaline substance (Calcium) is reacted with the casein. This helps to raise the mineral content of this form of casein.

**MILK PROTEIN CONCENTRATE 85**
-------------------------------

[Milk Protein Concentrate 85](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000) contains the two portions of protein found in milk, whey and casein in a 20% to 80% ratio. This provides a difference in the time of release of the amino acids.

The whey protein portions will release protein quickly to supply your muscles with amino acids, whereas casein portions will digest more slowly to release amino acids over a prolonged period of time.

Milk Protein Concentrate can be used in between meals, post workout or as a protein shake before bed.
