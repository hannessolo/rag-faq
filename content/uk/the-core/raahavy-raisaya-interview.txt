All of you reading this will have made new year’s goals, but keeping on track of those goals is where it gets difficult. Unfortunately it takes more than good intentions to hit your targets — you need a solid plan.

That’s why we sat down with our ambassador, Raahavy Raisaya, to find out how she makes sure she’s part of the nine% that reach their yearly goals. 

**Q: How are you doing today?**Currently feeling under the weather, but it’s okay.

**Q: So, are you taking it easy today?**A little bit. I’m having a chill day at home, but I’m still planning to make it to the gym later.

**Q: That’s dedication to go to the gym when you’re ill! Do you go to the gym every day?**Not every day. I go five times a week—Monday to Friday. It might not be the most optimal routine, but I like keeping my weekends free. I’ve been going for so long that my body’s used to it, and the gym helps me stay sane.

**Q: What inspired you to start your fitness journey?**I actually did karate for 11 years before I started going to the gym. I even got my black belt in my final year of university. But by then, I was getting a bit bored and felt stagnant. A friend who did powerlifting invited me to the gym, and I gave it a go. I did my first-ever squat, bench, and deadlift, and I’ve never looked back since.

**Q: How did you set your goals when you started?**I don’t set strict goals. Instead, I use milestones — like aiming for a new personal best. If someone says I can’t do something, it motivates me to prove them wrong. I think goals can sometimes feel like limitations. For me, it’s more about enjoying the process.

**Q: What keeps you motivated, especially on tough days?**My dad is a big inspiration. He runs a shop, works 16-hour days, and still finds time to go to the gym. He’ll send me photos of himself at the gym at 11 PM, and I think, “If he can do it, I have no excuse.”

Social media helps, too. People expect me to be disciplined, and I don’t want to be someone who isn’t genuine. If I say I’m going to do something, I’ll do it.

**Q: How do you handle setbacks or missed gym sessions?**I try not to beat myself up. Things like family events or vacations happen, and that’s okay. Missing a session isn’t the end of the world. The gym is important, but it’s not my whole life.

**Q: How do you balance the gym with your social life?**Most social events happen on weekends, which are my rest days, so it works out well. If there’s an event on a gym day, I’ll just move my workout around. I believe in being flexible but sticking to a routine where possible.

**Q: Do you have any habits that help you stay consistent?**I’m big on planning and organisation. I make daily to-do lists, even for small things like meal prep. Being organised has always been part of who I am, and it’s helped me a lot in my fitness journey.

**Q: How has being part of the Bulk community helped you?**The Bulk lifting club was the first time I met other fitness creators and got a taste of the gym community. It was eye-opening. Everyone was so nice, and it made me want to keep going to events like that.

Before Bulk, I didn’t take any supplements or pre-workout, but now I’ve added those to my routine. My favourite is Bulk’s Clear Whey in Peach Iced Tea flavour— I’ve tried other flavours and that has the best taste!

**Q: What advice would you give to someone struggling to stay consistent at the gym?**Don’t overthink it. Just show up. Start with four simple exercises and ask for help if you need it — people at the gym are usually happy to help.

For women who might feel intimidated, especially in weight rooms dominated by men, I’d say this: no one’s looking at you. Everyone’s focused on themselves. Just go for it.
