You may well be familiar with the concept of a complete food shake by now (there’s a certain black and white brand that dominates this marketplace in the UK). Any sports nutrition brand worth their gains now also has some sort of complete meal or complete food shake in their range.

We launched our first version of **[1™ Complete Food Shake](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/1-complete-food-shake/bpfs-one)** just over a year ago, and we’ve since given it a bit of a makeover. We feel that our new version is rather special in terms of taste, formula, convenience and (of course) the all-important price point.

**What makes our 1™ Complete Food shake different from other shakes?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The first thing to consider is that whilst high in protein, 1™ Complete Food Shake is not a protein shake. Our bestseller **[Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000?gclid=CjwKCAjwve2TBhByEiwAaktM1OjYOfTI9VxjFRzyHbLGn7Uuh9HbQeU0tiZPiIcWwOjPa-4boAN5choCqxsQAvD_BwE)** is made from **[whey protein concentrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000)**, with a touch of flavouring, thickener, colour and sweetener. It’s high in protein (as you’d expect), with little in the way of carbs and fats per 30g serving. 

Our 1™ Complete Food Shake takes a different approach. It’s vegan friendly and created using wholefoods, plant extracts, vitamins and minerals. It provides a balanced source of protein, carbs, fats and fibre, along with some Lutein, Zeaxanthin and Meso-Zeaxanthin from Lutemax 2020, [**Ashwagandha**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ashwagandha-capsules/bpb-ks66-0500) from KSM-66, Digestive Enzymes from DigeZyme and live cultures from LactoSpore (and breathe). There’s a lot going on in this shake.

**The nutritional benefits** 
-----------------------------

Per serving, 1™ Complete Food Shake delivers 30g protein, 37g carbs, 12g fat and 9.6g fibre. Looking at this in terms of energy balance, 30% of calories come from protein, 37% from carbs, 28% from fat and 5% from fibre. In addition, it includes at least 30% of your daily recommended intake of vitamins and minerals. What’s more, it equates to as little as £1.33 per serving. Not bad for a meal that’s ready in under a minute. All your macronutrients right here. So simple. 

**Is a complete food shake for me?**
------------------------------------

It’s important to emphasise that a complete food shake is a very, _very_ different product from your traditional meal replacement. Regulations around this category mean that any product claiming to be an actual meal replacement has to meet the criteria of being suitable for a very low calorie diet (VLCD). These tend to come in at around 200kcal per serving and have to be suitable for being the sole source of nutrition in an individual’s diet. They are absolutely essential for certain customer groups, but it’s not the aim of 1™ Complete Food Shake. 

Our complete food shake packs in 400kcal of quality nutrition per serving. It is designed to be consumed as a convenient part of a healthy, balanced diet. In a rush and have no lunch prepared for the day? Commuting and need some nutrition before your morning meeting? 1™ Complete Food Shake is your answer. Organised for the day, prepped all your meals and ready to go? Probably no great need for one today. And congratulations for being more organised than the author of this article. We like to think of it as a preferable and cheaper swap for your typical supermarket meal deal, without all the single-use packaging.

**So what are the headlines?** 
-------------------------------

We’ve got more than 1™ reason for you to try this product. (Sorry, couldn’t help that one).  We’ve been busy making some changes to the formula since our original version launched in 2021. We’ve introduced a new 700g trial size and have a new flavour. White Chocolate Coconut complements our existing Chocolate and Vanilla flavours. Get ready to take yourself to a tropical paradise with this one. 

**In summary** 
---------------

1™ Complete Food Shake tastes great (don’t just take our word for it, it’s seriously good). Working with the flavour of [**vegan proteins**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vegan/vegan-protein-powders) can be a challenge, as you have a lot of base notes to contend with. Pea protein, naturally, has a taste reminiscent of peas. And most other plant proteins have earthy notes that can be tough to work with. Switching from a **[whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein)** to a vegan protein can sometimes take a little getting used to. 

We’ve worked hard on this product to bring out flavours that will appeal to both vegans and non-vegans alike. Through clever purchasing, we’re now able to offer an everyday low price point of £39.99 (£1.33 per serving). Instead of your single-use plastic containers that come from supermarkets, each pouch is made from 100% home-compostable materials, allowing you to fuel the growth of more of the plants you’ve just consumed. Your sustainable and nutrition goals are hit in one tasty shake. So, what are you waiting for?
