FOUR New Nut Butters
--------------------

**NUT BUTTER 2**: [DARK CHOCOLATE ROASTED ALMOND BUTTER](https://www.bulk.com/uk/dark-chocolate-almond-butter.html "Dark Chocolate Almond Butter")

**NUT BUTTER 4**: [TRIPLE NUT BUTTER](https://www.bulk.com/uk/triple-nut-butter.html "Triple Nut Butter")

With Crunchy & Smooth Peanut Butter, Crunchy & Smooth Cashew Butter, Almond Butter and Pistachio Butter already on our roster of [nut butters](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-category/foods.html?bp_flavour=106,107,405,406,407 "BULK POWDERS™ Nut Butters") and taking the sports nutrition industry by storm, we’re excited to announce the launch of four **incredible** new arrivals.

It’s a hard task living up to the outstanding quality of our existing range. After all, our Cashew Butter was announced in the Best 10 Nut Butters 2014 by the Telegraph newspaper.

These four new releases solidify our reputation as THE place to go for your nut butter cravings. Like those mentioned above, they are 100% natural with no added preservatives or palm oil. They’re packed with good fats, high in protein and are a calorie dense food source.

Each tub is freshly made by hand – a lot of care and attention has gone into every tub.

### Triple Nut Butter

A luxurious, nutty blend of roasted almonds, roasted hazelnuts and roasted cashew nuts. If you already buy our Almond Butter and/or Cashew Butter, Triple Nut Butter must be on your shopping list.

### Dark Chocolate Roasted Hazelnut Butter

We receive many requests for hazelnut products and recently announced the launch of [INFORMED WHEY™ Chocolate Hazelnut Biscuit](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/pro-series/informed-whey.html "INFORMED WHEY™ Chocolate Hazelnut Biscuit"). Dark Chocolate Roasted Hazelnut Butter is one of those foods you can’t put down – one tablespoon could well turn out to be ten!

### Cinnamon Roasted Hazelnut Butter

Cinnamon is a popular spice, especially on porridge. Add Cinnamon Roasted Hazelnut Butter to your morning [Complete Protein Porridge™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-protein-porridge.html "Protein Porridge") and you’ll experience a taste like no other.

### Dark Chocolate Roasted Almond Butter

Almond Butter has grown a massive reputation as one of your go to nut butters. We’re constantly restocking the shelves because it constantly sells out. Dark Chocolate Roasted Almond Butter adds a delicious chocolatey flavour on top – a fantastic well balanced combination to leave you wanting more.

How to use nut butters
----------------------

Nut butters have many uses – don’t just spread them on your toast!

### From the spoon

Many customers like to simply grab a tablespoon and tuck in. With these new flavours, we wouldn’t blame you for doing so. They really do taste very special.

### In a protein shake

You might want to add a tablespoon to your protein shake. We already sell a [Chocolate Peanut Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-category/protein-supplements/whey-protein/pure-whey-protein.html "Chocolate Peanut whey protein") flavour that’s extremely popular. Add a dollop of nut butter into your chocolate shakes for a boost in protein, fats and fibre.

### In your oats

As mentioned above, add a spoonful into your porridge oats with a scoop of whey protein. Sprinkle our chia seeds, flax seed and/or psyllium husks on top and you have a healthy, nutritious meal.

We can’t wait to find out what you think about these four new arrivals. Let us know how you get on and some of the ways you’re using them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
