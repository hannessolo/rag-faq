Are your mornings a hectic schedule of training, sorting the kids (or yourself), and getting to work on time? Don’t let breakfast suffer. Here are some tasty, quick and easy high protein breakfast options.

### Liquid Egg Whites

What could be more convenient than low-calorie, high-protein egg whites in a bottle? We’ve done all the hard work for you so you don’t need to waste time or create a mess. You can cook up an omelette or egg-white crepe in less than 5 minutes using [liquid egg whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html "Liquid Egg Whites"). If you’re pushed for time (or macros), have an egg white and veggie omelette. If you’ve got a little more wiggle room, there are loads of options: from protein French toast to [protein pancakes](../../complete-high-protein-pancakes.html "Protein Pancakes")!

### Make a Smoothie

If you’ve got 5 minutes to spare, make yourself a healthy smoothie which you can take with you and drink on the go (or at your desk). We’d suggest a combination of [ultra-fine Scottish oats](../../ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html "Ultra Fine Scottish Oats"), [whey protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html "Whey Protein") and [flaxseed powder](../../flaxseed-powder.html "Flaxseed Powder") for a balanced approach to slow-release carbs, protein and healthy fats. You could even add a serving of Complete Greens to boost your micronutrient intake all before 9am!

### Complete Breakfast Smoothie™

If a smoothie sounds like too much effort (and washing up) first thing in the morning, don’t worry – we’ve done the leg work for you with our [Complete Breakfast Smoothie](../../complete-breakfast-protein-smoothie.html "Complete Breakfast Smoothie")™. It’s a combination of whey protein, ultra-fine Scottish oats, [psyllium husk powder](../../psyllium-husks-powder.html "Psyllium Husk Powder"), our popular fruit powders, real fruit pieces, and DigeZyme® digestive aid. It’s more than just a jazzed-up whey shake. It really is like a smoothie from a cafe, but a lot healthier of course, and much higher in protein. It mixes up amazingly thick and delivers over 23g protein along with just enough carbohydrate and fibre.

### Complete Protein Porridge™

In the mornings, there’s nothing nicer than a bowl of steamy, creamy oats. But who has time to stand over a pan whilst the kids are getting ready for school? Life got easier when we created [Complete Protein Porridge](../../complete-protein-porridge.html "Complete Protein Porridge")™! Just add boiling water to this tasty combination of real porridge oats and hydrolysed whey protein isolate (which is heat-stable), mix, and eat. You could even take it with you if you’re pushed for time – either reheat at work, or let the oats soak up the water and enjoy as a thick, cooled oat breakfast. The benefit of using Complete Protein Porridge™ over making your own “proats” is speed and convenience, and the benefits to using it over store-bought quick cook porridge oats is the nutritionals (more protein, less sugar, less salt). Complete Protein Porridge™ really is tasty – your only problem will be choosing a favourite flavour between chocolate raspberry and butterscotch.

### Complete High Protein Pancakes™

Pancakes in the morning; pancakes at night. There is never a bad time to eat [Complete High Protein Pancakes](../../complete-high-protein-pancakes.html "Complete High Protein Pancakes")™, especially when they deliver a whopping 36g protein per serving, courtesy of a fast & slow multi-release protein blend! Pop some [coconut oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "Coconut Oil") in the pan, cook on a medium-to-high heat for 1-2 minutes each side and you’re done! Accessorise with some of our fantastic nut butters if you want a few more fats and calories to power you through the day.

Never skip breakfast again – set yourself up for the day and still have enough energy to train hard when gym time rolls around!
