It’s fair to say that eggs cause quite a stir, with much debate about the cholesterol found in egg yolks and their respective impact on our health. The main point of contention seems to be the link between eggs and increased levels of LDL (bad cholesterol).

But a recent post from the Harvard School of Public Health outlines current thinking, which is in-fact that whilst eggs do contain a lot of cholesterol, their impact on blood cholesterol levels is minimal – and the nutrients found in eggs, such as protein, vitamin B12 and riboflavin, are thought to help lower the risk of heart disease.

So, are egg whites good for you? What’s clear is that the mighty egg is an all-natural source of protein – one of the highest of any food available, and whether you eat a whole egg or just the egg white, you’ll be consuming something very nutritious!

1) No yolks (less calories)
---------------------------

If you’re mindful of the cholesterol content of egg yolks, what better way to avoid the uncertainty by taking the yolk out of the equation altogether? Our [liquid egg whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html) are pre-separated from the yolks – meaning you have a quick and convenient way to consume egg whites without the hassle of cracking eggs! Did we mention they are free of artificial flavours, preservatives and added sugar too?

2) Long shelf-life
------------------

Due to a unique pasteurisation process, liquid egg whites have an incredible 5-month shelf life at room temperature (provided they are unopened!). This means if your fridge space is at a premium, you can store the bottled egg whites in a cool place without any fuss. Simply move them to the fridge once opened and consume within 48 hours.

3) Low in carbs
---------------

Whilst eggs are by no means ‘calorific’, [liquid egg whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html) are an almost pure protein – with fewer carbs and fat content than a standard egg.

4) Convenient
-------------

Conveniently available in bottles, you can buy the right quantity for what you need, reducing any waste.
