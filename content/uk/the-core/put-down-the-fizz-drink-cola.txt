Did you know a 200ml serving of a popular fizzy drink contains the equivalent of five teaspoons of sugar? Diet options can sound like a healthy alternative, but this may not always be the case. Consuming food and drink that has more nutritional and health benefits is always a better option. When we are thirsty- water is the best choice, but sometimes we look for a little something extra.

An American research team from Purdue University in 2011 carried out a study on rats that found when the body doesn’t receive the calories it craves, our body’s mechanism for controlling food intake becomes confused. This can lead us to consume more. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘Big Mac and Diet Coke’ phenomenon.

So why drink low calorie fizzy drinks when we have options that are better for our health with a better nutritional profile and that don’t sacrifice on taste.

### **Welcome Instant BCAA in Cola.**

Cola flavoured [BCAA Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/instantised-bcaa/bpb-ibca-0000) (sometimes referred to as iBCAA and suitable for both men and women) is a great cola alternative, tastes exactly like cola – just without the fizz. But don’t think you’ll be getting a horrible flat drink – it’s extremely refreshing (especially during a workout or in hot weather) and goes down a treat (we’ve received hundreds of positive reviews).

Cola Instant BCAA will help promote muscle growth, reduce muscle breakdown, reduce muscle soreness after a workout and during a workout, will help decrease fatigue and lead to increased fat oxidation (just like drinking [Green Tea](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/green-tea-extract-powder/bpb-gtea-0000) would). Nutritionally Cola Instant BCAA is very low in calories (approx. 30-50 per serving) and has no carbohydrates. It contains a small amount of sucralose but so do most [whey protein supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein). The best part, only natural flavouring and natural colours have been used to create the delicious Cola taste.

Ideal whether you’re working out or just want a refreshing drink to sip on throughout the day. You don’t need to be a bodybuilder to drink it! Cola Instant BCAA or a simple cup of water should always take precedence over traditional fizzy drinks. We even have Apple & Lime, Mixed Berry and Tropical flavours that taste just as good.

Give flavoured Instant BCAA a try – it’s a great cola alternative.
