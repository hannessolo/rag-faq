Some would say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Give yourself a reason to get out of bed in the morning with our tempting homemade healthy granola recipe.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.) Preheat the oven to 180c.

2.) Combine the oats, chopped nuts and cinnamon into a bowl.

3.) Pour over the coconut oil and honey and mix well so that everything is evenly coated.

4.) Transfer the mixture into a baking dish and spread evenly. Cook in the oven for 7 minutes, then toss the granola and add in the coconut chips.

5.) Return this to the oven for a further 8 minutes, or until it’s nicely golden brown.

6.) Serve in a bowl and top with a handful of raisins.
