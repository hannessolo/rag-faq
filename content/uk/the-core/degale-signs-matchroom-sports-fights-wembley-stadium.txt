BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale has today agreed to sign with **Matchroom Sports**. James’ future fights will be live on Sky Sports, starting with a final eliminator for the **IBF World title** on May 31st at Wembley Stadium. James’ opponent will be undefeated American **Brandon Gonzales** and the fight will be the chief support on the **Carl Froch Vs George Groves** bill. The winners of DeGale Vs Gonzales and Froch Vs Groves will face each other later in the year for the IBF World Title.

Despite a mouth-watering clash with the winner of Carl Froch Vs George Groves awaiting the winner of DeGale Vs Gonzales, James is fully focused on the short term. Gonzales is a tough opponent, having had 19 fights, winning 18 with 1 bout scored a draw (against highly regarded South African Thomas Oosthuizen) and is not to be taken lightly. James will certainly take confidence that Gonzales has never gone the 12 round championship distance (and has only been ten rounds twice), whereas 10 of James’ 19 fights have been scheduled for 12 rounds. James said, “I can’t wait for May 31st. The Gonzales fight at Wembley Stadium is absolutely huge for me, and I’ve already started my preparations for the fight.”

2014 is going to be a great year for James DeGale, as he continues toward making history and becoming the first British boxer to win an Olympic Gold medal and a professional world title. As always, BULK POWDERS™ will be supporting James every step of the way!
