When it comes to sports nutrition, for many years carbohydrates were seen as the enemy to achieving a lean, toned and muscular physique. In recent years, this myth has been dispelled, as carbohydrates are in fact a very important, and vital macronutrient for achieving your training goals.

However, there are some carbohydrates that can be considered better than others and one of the best carbohydrates you can use to fuel your body are **oats**. In this article, we’ll be looking at why oats are considered a healthy choice to include in your diet. Plus, we’ll share our tips on how to include oats in a protein shake.

Why Are Oats Considered Healthy?
--------------------------------

Oats are an extremely healthy source of carbohydrates as they contain beta-glucans. They’re a form of highly soluble fibre, which acts to slow down the absorption of carbohydrates into the bloodstream.

It is this slower digestion which sets them apart from a number of other carbohydrate sources. A slower digestion process prevents spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels. Fast absorbing carbohydrates can provide the body with a quick source of energy, but this is then followed by a ‘crash’, which can leave you feeling tired and lethargic. Oats will provide your body with a slow-releasing source of energy over an extended period of time, helping to fuel your body.

Oats are also high in **magnesium**, which is a macro-mineral, meaning your body needs it in large amounts. This mineral is essential for a number of bodily functions including **energy production**.

If you want to train effectively then you need a good source of energy, and oats are certainly a great food source to get it!

The Benefits of Ultra Fine Oats
-------------------------------

One of the best ways to consume oats on a daily basis is by using our [Ultra Fine Scottish Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ultra-fine-scottish-oats/bpb-oats-0000).

Sure, you get the same benefits from standard rolled oats, however, powdered oats offer you convenience.

How long does it take you to prepare your rolled oats? Maybe 2-4 minutes in the microwave, followed by another 2-3 minutes waiting for them to cool down enough for you to eat them.

How long does it take you to consume instant oats? About 30 seconds. Just add 1 scoop of instant oats to a shaker with 200ml of water or milk, shake it and you’re ready to go. It’s as easy as that.

Adding 1 scoop of instant oats and 1 scoop of [whey protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) in a shaker can provide you with a nutritious and great tasting breakfast, which is high in protein, carbs and fibre. Take into consideration how quick it is to prepare and you could save precious time in the morning, as well as fuelling yourself for the day ahead. Our [protein porridge](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-protein-porridge/bble-cppo) is also a popular option for a quick and tasty protein fix in the morning. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day, so make sure you’re starting your day in the best way possible.
