Natural natural natural (or natty for those in the know). It’s on the lips of many of us who lift. We’re not going to talk about natty or ‘fake natty’ bodybuilders here, we will instead talk about natural protein powder supplements… well… except posting these pictures of our natural bodybuilding champions [Matt Argall](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/the-competition-diet-top-tips-from-world-champion-bodybuilder-matt-argall/) and [Rachael Owen](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/fit-mum-no-problem-rachael-owen/), just because they’re awesome.

[Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™ is our number 1 best seller. It’s a superb protein powder at cracking value for money. For any flavour, you’ll get over 22g of protein and a protein shake that’s low in calories, low in sugar, low in carbs, low in fat. The whey protein is derived from grass fed cows and sourced from Europe’s leading dairy, the same dairy we’ve used and trusted since 2005. It’s sweetened with sucralose – a tiny amount at just 0.04g per 30g serving.

Pure Whey Protein™ continues to sell extremely well as one of the UK’s best protein shakes, on our website and Amazon. But in recent years there has been more of a demand for what is termed as ‘natural protein powder’. That’s a protein shake sweetened naturally (i.e. with Stevia) with all natural flavours and colourings.

We always listen to our customers and take on board what you want. Some of you wanted a natural protein powder. So with this in mind, we created [Natural Pure Whey Protein](../../natural-pure-whey-protein.html)™. Then two weeks ago we launched [Natural Pure Whey Isolate™ 90](../../natural-pure-whey-isolate-90.html). What are the differences?

The highest quality Stevia
--------------------------

Natural Pure Whey Protein™ and Natural Pure Whey Isolate™ 90 are sweetened with the finest quality Stevia. Most websites selling natural protein powder won’t tell you about the quality of Stevia used which puts doubt in the mind.

We use Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni. Rebaudioside A (Reb A) which is the purest extract of the Stevia leaf. This is an unrivalled 98% pure version, providing the cleanest possible taste with no nasty bitterness often associated with other Stevia.

More natural sports nutrition
-----------------------------

As well as protein powder, well sell plenty more ‘natural’ sports nutrition products.

Examples of BULK POWDERS™ natural products include Coconut Water Powder, Peanut Butter, Cashew Butter, Almond Butter and Matcha Green Tea Powder.

Whatever your preference when it comes to buying sports nutrition supplements, with over 1,500 products and growing weekly, we’ve got something for everyone.
