What is MSM?
------------

MSM is a popular joint health supplement and is one of the few supplements in this category that has been investigated for it use in both pain management and reduction of symptoms of degenerative joint conditions [such as osteoarthritis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21708034).

Aside from its popularity as a joint protection supplement, MSM has been used to promote healthy hair, and there is evidence for its use in reducing muscle damage after exercise and symptoms of DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness).

MSM is the commonly used name (and for good reason!) for methylsulfonylmethane and is an organic sulphur compound that is stated to be a biologically effective source of sulphur for use in the body. Sulphur is important in the body and it is found in many amino acids that are used to create enzymes, which allow processes in the body to take place, including energy metabolism, and one of these major processes is in the production of collagens.

Collagens come in different ‘types’ and these types are important for providing the different types of functions that collagen play. Collagen is present in bone, cartilage, ligaments and tendons as well as muscle fascia, hair and skin… so by providing enough sulphur the body, this can allow the repair of damaged tissues and this is where the proposed benefits of MSM lie.

How can I supplement with MSM?
------------------------------

MSM is available in several forms, including MSM powder that can easily be added to other supplements in the dose you require to make your own supplement ‘stack’. [Doses of MSM are suggested to be in the region of 3000mg (3g) per day](https://examine.com/supplements/methylsulfonylmethane/), which is the dosage found in many of the studies where MSM has shown benefits in terms of reducing muscle soreness and symptoms of osteoarthritis.  MSM is most popular in tablet or capsule form and is often combined with other joint protection supplements such glucosamine sulphate and/or chondroitin.

[Glucosamine](https://examine.com/supplements/glucosamine/) is found naturally in the body in structural collagens and is therefore used to help prevent breakdown of cartilage and has been associated with reduced rates of cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis. [Chondroitin](https://examine.com/supplements/chondroitin/) is another naturally occurring compound that has a similar structural ‘makeup’ as cartilage.

There is only limited data on the effectiveness of these supplements, so to what extent they will help and in which situations is not clear. But there is enough evidence in the research, and from anecdotal reports, that in combination with each other and with MSM in particular there is likely to be some benefit as a joint protection supplement.

At BULK POWDERS® we provide a selection of joint protection supplements, such as our [100% pure MSM](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/msm-methyl-sulfonyl-methane/bpb-msm-0000), Glucosamine and Chondroitin and our [Complete Joint Restore](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-joint-restore/bble-cjre) formula which combines chondroitin, glucosamine and ‘cissus quadrangularis’… another supplement which has shown potential benefits in promoting healthy bone and joints, becoming a popular choice in athletes.

MSM Benefits
------------

Due to the properties of MSM as an [anti-oxidant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21899544) and anti-inflammatory, there is some evidence to suggest that MSM may be useful in several situations where these properties may be of benefit.

Its anti-inflammatory effects may be useful in reducing [muscle damage and soreness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22525653), which may be of benefit for those who perform taxing training or sporting events where time for recovery might be restricted.  If we consider the other inflammatory conditions those who train might be concerned with, such as tendonitis, then MSM might also have some positive influence.

The [antioxidant properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23013531) of MSM has potential wide-reaching benefits, especially for tissues like hair and skin which are under lots of environmental stress this has some, as yet fully investigated, potential to help people with dry and damaged skin or hair and this has made MSM a popular supplement for those with these conditions.

Does MSM any side effects?
--------------------------

Although MSM does not have a recommended dose, there has been no reported issues taking doses recommended above. Even much higher doses have no reported side effects so MSM should be considered very safe to take.

Summary
-------

MSM is an increasingly popular supplement that has a good amount of evidence for its effectiveness especially in degenerative joint conditions such as osteoarthritis. These benefits are most likely due to the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of MSM and these properties are likely to have other impacts on muscle damage and soreness as well as several inflammatory conditions in the body.
