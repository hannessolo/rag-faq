\*\* NEW PRODUCT LAUNCH \*\* | Complete Bedtime™
------------------------------------------------

### What is Complete Bedtime™?

Train. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. A common phrase bandied about around the fitness community. Sleep is just as important as training hard and eating well for muscular growth and recovery. Bedtime supplementation is particularly popular amongst the CrossFit community due to the extreme nature of WOD training protocol.

[Complete Bedtime™](../../complete-bedtime.html "Complete Bedtime™ Protein") is an alternative option to our popular Micellar Casein from the mighty Pure Series™.

Complete Bedtime™ is a Micellar Casein blend (Premium Grass Fed Casein), utilised due to its slow absorption rate, that supplies a steady flow of muscle preserving amino acids into the muscles. At 30g protein per 35g serving (86% protein), you’ll get an abundance of protein and amino acids to help reduce muscle breakdown and wastage whilst you relax in a deep, comfortable sleep.

### Added ingredients

**Leucine and HMB** have been included because they are the perfect duo for increasing protein synthesis, promoting muscle growth, as well as reducing muscle damage.

Unlike our direct ‘bulk’ competitors bedtime supplements that contain no ‘sleep promoting’ ingredients (essentially glorified protein blends), we’ve also included **Tryptophan** – an amino acid that promotes high quality sleep by raising melatonin and serotonin levels. We have also added **Lysine and Theanine** into the mix which both help lower anxiety and promote a relaxed state.

Compared with two bedtime supplements specifically targeted at the **CrossFit** community, our formulation is significantly higher in protein, has more active ingredients (double in one instance), is better dosed, contains no fillers such as sugar and Maltodextrin and is a cheaper price.

As you can see, we have the most comprehensive formula whilst also delivering a **massive 86% protein per serving** – significantly more than any other bedtime protein supplement.

### Who’s it for?

*   Anyone who trains at intensity
*   Anyone who wants to fuel their muscles whilst sleeping with a plethora of sleep promoting active ingredients at optimum dosages
*   Anyone who has trouble sleeping post training
*   Anyone who wants to improve recovery time

### Flavours

Complete Bedtime™ is available in two great tasting flavours – Chocolate and Strawberry.

Four size options – 500g, 1kg, 2.5kg and 5kg.
