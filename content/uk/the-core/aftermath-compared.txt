[AFTERMATH™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/aftermath.html) utilises Whey Protein Isolate as the primary protein source, as well as the patented sports performance carbohydrate Vitargo. It doesn’t stop there either; the key amino acid L-Leucine, has been added, as have premium Glutamine Peptides. Creatine Monohydrate (in the form of Creapure™). This combination of nutrients makes AFTERMATH™ a great post-workout drink.

What’s more, the AFTERMATH™ formula is totally transparent – the exact form and quantity of each ingredient is declared, as opposed to us incorporating inferior sources of ingredients and hiding behind proprietary blends where ingredient amounts are indeterminable. After all, you deserve to know exactly what you are putting into your body.

As such, when you’re looking to purchase an all in one supplement, it is important to consider quality, protein percentage, added ingredients, as well as value for money.
