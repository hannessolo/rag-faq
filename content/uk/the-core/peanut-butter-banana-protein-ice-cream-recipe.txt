Peanut butter and Banana Fudge flavour protein combined to create ice cream. Eat this and you’re definitely winning at life.

Put down your Ben & Jerry’s and try this homemade ice-cream that delivers over 20g protein per serving (if you have any self control).

Research papers published in the Journal of Gains show that eating Peanut Butter Banana Protein Ice Cream whilst listening to [#BULKBEATS](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/workout-music/) builds muscle and quickens recovery times.

### **Instructions**

1.) Blitz everything in a blender

2.) Pour into a bowl and stick in freezer for a couple of hours, stirring at least once half way through

3.) Once you can scrape it into a ball using your ice-cream scooper, it’s ready

Tastes amazing on its own, but if you’re feeling naughty, add some PB chips. You won’t regret it!

Perfect post-workout treat!

Recipe yielded 4 servings.
