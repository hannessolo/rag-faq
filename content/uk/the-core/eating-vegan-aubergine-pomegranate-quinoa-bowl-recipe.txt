We’ve been in the kitchen cooking up some tasty vegan dishes with Lucy Watson. First on the menu? An Aubergine & Pomegranate Quinoa Bowl, the perfect combination of salty & sweet.

Grain bowls are a great way to ensure you’re getting a balanced lunch with plenty of vegetables, wholegrains and protein. Inspired by Moroccan flavors, this dish is perfect for those looking for a lunch that is filling without being too heavy. Oh – and it’s 100% vegan!

Ingredients (Serves 2):
-----------------------

*   Pinch of saffron threads
*   2 large aubergines cut into slices

9.  Put the tahini into the bowl with the saffron water and add the yoghurt, the remaining lemon juice and the maple syrup. Stir well.
