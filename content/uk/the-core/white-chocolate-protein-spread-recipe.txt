### Summary

A natural progression from the [protein white chocolate recipe](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/protein-white-chocolate-recipe/ "Protein White Chocolate Recipe"), here’s a great way to create a white chocolate protein spread which you can spread over anything you want – and why not spruce it up with a sprinkle of white chocolate pieces too?!

### Instructions

1.) Melt your Cashew butter, [coconut oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/organic-virgin-coconut-oil/bpf-ovco "Coconut Oil") and agave in a bowl, again microwave or bain marie.

2.) Now, the mix has to be hot to mix it well so don’t go mixing it without warming it up somehow.

3.) Stir in your whey and mix it all up well. If you find that your mix is too runny, simply add more [cashew butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/cashew-butter/bpf-cbut "Cashew Butter"), don’t add more whey as it will become too powdery.

Makes approx. 250g
