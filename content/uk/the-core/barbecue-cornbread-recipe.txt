Some say that he is the only man in history to buy a DFS sofa when there wasn’t a sale on, and that he once ate 12 Weetabix post workout, without milk. All we know is he’s called The Beltsander.

Cornbread is a common cuisine in the South and South Western states of America. But that doesn’t mean we can’t eat it round the barbecue here as well. A really quick and easy recipe using our Smokey Barbecue protein peanut butter, unflavoured whey protein powder and Vitafiber Powder. Enjoy with your [barbecue pulled pork](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/barbecue-pulled-pork-rolls-recipe/).

### **Instructions**

1.) Combine the dry ingredients together

2.) Then add the Liquid Egg Whites, Greek Yoghurt and Almond Milk.

3.) Bake at 150c for around 20 minutes or until golden. You can check if it’s done by inserting a toothpick into the centre. If it comes out clean, its done.
