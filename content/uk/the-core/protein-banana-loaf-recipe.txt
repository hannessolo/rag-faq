The Muscle Bakery has created a Protein Banana Loaf using two of our hidden gems – ModCARB™ (organic super grains formula) and Peanut Flour. Both ingredients are tailor made for baking protein bread, cakes and adding into your pancakes mixes. Use your loaf and try this simple three step recipe.

### **Instructions**

1.) Preheat oven to 160 Degrees C.

2.) Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, in no particular order, just making sure to leave the vinegar till the end.

3.) Pour the mix into 2 loaf silicone moulds or lined loaf pans and bake for approximately 45 minutes.

This one needs to cook on low heat for longer or else the outer part will burn and the inside will remain uncooked.

You will know it’s done when the Protein Banana Loaf is soft and springy to the touch. However if you want to make sure, stick a knife into it. If you still have batter on the tip, bake for longer.

Recipe yielded 2 loaves with 10 slices each.

### Toppings

We topped the Protein Banana Loaf with BULK POWDERS™ [Natural Peanut Butter.](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut)
