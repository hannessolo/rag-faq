What happens when you combine a classic with a little bit of flavour, and a sprinkle of magic? **Birthday Cake Mini Donuts**…that’s what happens.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.) Preheat oven to 150 Degrees C.

2.) Spray your doughnut pan with low-cal oil spray or coconut oil if you prefer using that and placein oven to heat up while you prepare mix.

3.) Mix together all ingredients except for white chocolate and sprinkles, until you get a thick gloopy batter.

4.) Remove doughnut pan from oven and begin filling it with your batter. Do not fill to the top, half way will suffice as your doughnuts will rise!

5.) Bake for 15 mins approx. Until doughnuts have risen, are golden and soft/springy to the touch.

6.) Leave to cool completely.

7.) Melt white chocolate, either in microwave or over a water bath.

8.) Coat your doughnuts halfway, or entirely (depending on your macro allowance).

Yields 12 pieces.
