If you’re not a fan of dairy but you enjoy a healthy treat, give this **Dairy Free Cherry Banana Bakes recipe** a whirl. Each slice contains a magnificent 8g protein, using our [Beef Protein Isolate 97](../../beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef.html) and [Chocolate Liquiflav](../../liquiflav.html) for needed flavouring.

**Instructions:**

1.) Preheat oven to 170 Degrees C.

2.) In no particular order, mix all the ingredients into a bowl until well combined and you have a thick batter.

3.) Pour batter into a square silicon mold or into a square lined baking tray and bake for approximately 20-25mins.

4.) Leave to cool completely, then place in freezer to harden up slightly. Once hardened, slice it up and you can either wrap each individually or place all in a storage container OR eat them all… up to you.

5.) The reason we suggest placing in freezer prior to slicing is because they will be slightly squidgy and messy otherwise.

Recipe yields 12 slices.
