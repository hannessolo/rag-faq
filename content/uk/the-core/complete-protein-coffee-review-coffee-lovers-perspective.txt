Protein and real coffee in one product? What’s not to love! Coffee is a staple in many bodybuilders’ diets (for some of us, it’s practically a food group all of its own). So the idea of real coffee, mixed with protein powder, in a tailor-made blend…. intriguing.

### I was excited but sceptical

As a card-carrying coffee aficionado, I admit I was excited but sceptical about the idea of a [protein coffee](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/collagen-coffee/bpf-pcof "Protein Coffee") blend. Surely the coffee chosen wouldn’t be all that great? What about mixability: wouldn’t it be clumpy? And let’s not forget the purpose of protein coffee: how would the protein fare in hot water?

### As good as any instant coffee I’ve had

All my concerns were quickly put to rest: the coffee used in BULK POWDERS™ Complete Protein Coffee™ is real Columbian coffee, on a par with the premium instant coffee you might already have in your kitchen cupboard. Sure, it’s not freshly ground, homemade espresso, but then that’s not what I expected. I knew it would be instant, but was worried about taste and quality.

The verdict? Tastes great! As good as any instant coffee I’ve had, and better than a lot of them!

### Developed to mix up perfectly with boiling water

What about mixability? How can you pour boiling water onto [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein "Pure Whey Protein") and expect it to mix smoothly without any kind of blender or shaker? BULK POWDERS™ use heat-stable [Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hydrolysed-whey-protein-isolate/bpb-hwpi-0000 "Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate") (WPI) which has been specifically developed to mix up perfectly with boiling water: no clumping or separating. It truly does just mix up into a smooth cup (and the white coffee version looks just like regular white coffee). The addition of a small amount of MCTs help create a slightly creamy taste and mouthfeel.

The verdict? Mixes perfectly, no shaker or blender required. Just make it like a cup of instant coffee.

Lastly, doesn’t pouring boiling water on to whey isolate defeat the object? Not at all. The hydrolysed WPI used in this product is heat-stable and neither the protein levels nor amino acid content is affected by heat.

### I’ll happily keep a bag of it alongside my various bags of espresso grounds

The bottom line is that nothing will convince me to give up my carefully-chosen choice of espresso grounds, but I don’t drink espresso for the same reason that I’d use this Protein Coffee. As a pre-workout, blending caffeine (in its tastiest form) and a quick blast of whey isolate, this product is not just unique, it’s brilliant. Nice work, BULK POWDERS™! I’ll happily keep a bag of it alongside my various bags of espresso grounds. After all, you can never have too much coffee… right?
