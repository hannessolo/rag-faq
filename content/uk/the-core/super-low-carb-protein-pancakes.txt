### Summary:

Here’s another quick and easy recipe for Super Low Carb Protein Pancakes which can be dressed up with some of our nut butters (try [peanut butter](../../peanut-butter.html "Peanut Butter")) or fresh fruit; or both.

### Instructions:

1.) Blend all the ingredients, bar the coconut oil.

2.) Melt a little coconut oil in medium-high pan.

3.) Spoon into the pan your pancake mixture, turn the heat down and flip over carefully when bubbles start to appear on the surface.

4.) Repeat until all your batter is cooked and remember the secret to good pancakes is patience.

5.) Serve with your favourite BULK POWDERS™ nut butter, Greek yogurt or fruit and lashings of syrup.
