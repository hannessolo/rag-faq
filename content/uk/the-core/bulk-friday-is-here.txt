Bulk™ Friday is here. We’ve made shopping even easier with an edit of our top picks in this year’s sale. What’s more, spend just £30 during the sale period to get a free, limited edition shaker as well as your choice of delicious protein snack. We’ve been working on two limited edition, protein-packed treats for you to choose from this year.

Double Chocolate Millionaires Slice
-----------------------------------

If you thought our Protein Millionaires Slice answered all of your protein snack dreams, then get ready for it to be taken to the next level. Our super chocolatey, double chocolate millionaires slice is guaranteed to satisfy your sweet cravings – consisting of a cocoa oat base with a rich caramel layer, topped off with a delicious thick layer of dark chocolate. Providing 15g of protein per slice, this snack not only tastes amazing, but will help you to achieve your fitness goals!

Gourmet Vegan Bar – Dark Chocolate & Salted Caramel
---------------------------------------------------

Our vegan customers have missed out on our Macro Munch bars for some time now, so it’s only fair for us to offer a vegan alternative. Designed to change the vegan protein bar snacking game, we’re very excited to introduce you to our new Gourmet Vegan Bar. A delicious combination of sweet and salty, our rich double chocolate and salted caramel multilayer bar ticks all the boxes in terms of flavour and macros. Low in sugar (less than 1g of sugar per bar) and high in protein with a generous offering of 16g of protein per bar, it’s an enjoyable and convenient way for vegans to increase their protein intake.
