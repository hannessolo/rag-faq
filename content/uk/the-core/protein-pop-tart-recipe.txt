Some people believe that back in prehistoric times, when the asteroids hit and the dinosaurs were wiped out, the only thing remaining on earth was The Beltsander and his original recipe creations etched into stone.

All we know is that he makes a formidable **Protein Pop Tart recipe** and it boasts an almighty 67g protein! It’s impossible not to taste to gains!

### Instructions:

1.) Add the **VitaFiber™ Powder** to a large mug along with water and microwave for about a minute or until it turns clear.

2.) Add your **whey** to a separate bowl.

3.) Pour the **syrup** into the **whey** quickly mix to combine into a rough dough.

4.) Split the dough in half and shape the roughly into two rectangles.

5.) Mix the PB2 with a little later and spread it across the centre of one rectangle.

6.) Cove with other rectangle and seal the edges with a fork.

7.) Bake at 180ºC for about 10 minute, and allow it to cool.

8.) Mix the honey and **Cocoa** together and add it to the top.
