If you are wondering – what actually _is_ a frittata? Don’t worry, you’re in the right place. A frittata is an egg-based dish similar to an omelette that combines egg whites with a variety ingredients you might have on hand. This no-fuss recipe is a great way to pack in the veggies and is easy to change up by adding in your favourite ingredients. Perfect for a quick and tasty breakfast or healthy lunchtime meal, it makes a great side dish too – what’s not to love?
