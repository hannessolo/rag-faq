**Healthy Sugar Alternatives**
==============================

If you’re trying to cut down on processed white sugar in your life, check out these healthier alternatives for sprinkling, stirring, and baking.

There’s nothing wrong with white sugar per se, but there’s no getting away from the fact that it’s high in calories and low in nutrients. White sugar has one job: to give you a massive jolt of pure energy (calories!) very quickly.

If you’re more interested in having a little nutritional benefit alongside your energy, try replacing traditional forms of sugar with alternatives. Here are some of the best for sweetening your drinks, snacks, and baking recipes.

**Caster Sugar Alternative**
----------------------------

Caster sugar is the fine white granulated type of sugar that sits somewhere between Granulated Sugar and Icing Sugar (in terms of granule size). It’s often used in baking recipes, and to sweeten tea and coffee. For an alternative to caster sugar that has some benefits (besides energy!), try [Xylitol](https://www.bulk.com/uk/xylitol.html) – a natural, low calorie sweetener which is low on the Glycemic Index. It even has the same granulated texture. Or you could try [Stevia extract powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/stevia-extract-powder/bpb-stev-0000), which is an all-natural alternative to caster sugar.

**Palm Sugar Alternative**
--------------------------

Palm sugar is an umbrella term for any sugar that originally comes from the sap of any kind of palm tree. Because of this, it’s often found in ethnic recipes like Thai, Malay, and Chinese. For a healthy palm sugar substitute, try our Organic Coconut Palm Sugar which is 100% natural, organically certified, and gives a lovely flavour to your baking or cooking.

**Muscovado Sugar Alternative**
-------------------------------

Muscovado Sugar is that deep, dark coloured sugar with a distinctive rich smell. The colour, texture, and aroma comes from the fact that it is only partially refined. For this reason, it has slightly higher levels of some minerals than white sugar does. But there are healthier alternatives. If you like your sugar to be high in minerals, give our Organic Lucama powder a try. It’s not strictly a sweetener, but it is a sweet flavouring option with a rich, deep taste and a lovely aroma. It’s a good source of calcium, phosphorous, and other micronutrients. Lots better for you than Muscovado!

**Icing Sugar Alternative**
---------------------------

Icing Sugar is that super fine, light white flour that’s used for dusting and decorating. It’s intensely sweet, and not much good for sprinkling (or stirring) because it goes everywhere. There are much better choices than icing sugar – especially if you like your protein baking. For an icing sugar alternative that won’t make your dentist cringe, try a sprinkling of [VitaFiber™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitafiber-powder/bpb-vfib-0000) powder which is a natural sweetener very low in calories with the added benefit of being high in fibre too. If you enjoy healthy protein baking, VitaFiber™ is a great addition to your kitchen. We have a ton of VitaFiber™ [recipes on The Core™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/diet-and-nutrition/recipes/)!

**Sugar Alternatives for Tea**
------------------------------

Some people just can’t get on with unsweetened tea. If hot sweet tea is up there with Wi-Fi on your pyramid of human needs, there’s no need to cut sweetener out of your life. Ditch the sugar lumps, and try sweetening your tea with our [LiquiFlav™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/liquiflav.html) drops instead. Not only are they calorie-free, but you can choose different flavours (vanilla is lovely in tea and chocolate gives coffee a mocha flavour). Plus they go much further than a bag of sugar (and are much easier to carry in your bag!). If you miss the spoon-and-stir routine of adding white sugar to your tea, the best alternative would be [Sucralose](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/sucralose/bmat-sucr-0000).

Cutting down on sugar has never been easier or tastier – there are so many options available to you. Make the switch and you might even discover that you prefer the alternatives!
