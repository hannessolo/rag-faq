Hebe, the people’s baker, has been **_eggtremely_** busy these past few days, working on some festive Easter recipes. We’re not _**eggxaggerating**_ when we say she’s done a cracking job…try this Chocolate Protein Eggs with Banana Almond Butter recipe yourself, for a dairy, grain and gluten free treat!

### Instructions

1.) Melt the **Coconut Oil** in a small non-stick saucepan. Stir in the cacao/cocoa powder. Stir in the **Chocolate HydroBEEF**™. Keep mixing until combined. Sprinkle over the **Stevia** and mix in.

2.) Grab your silicone egg mould. Put about a tsp of the chocolate mix in the bottom and spread it up the sides. Repeat to make to make about 4 eggs. Pop in the freezer until firm.

3.) Meanwhile, mix together the almond butter and **Banana Fudge HydroBEEF™**. Keep mixing and it will eventually come together into a ball. Divide this into 4 small log shapes.

4.) Remove the egg shells from the freezer. Put a log of the banana almond mixture in the shell and press down. Cover with a generous half tsp of the remaining chocolate mixture. **Note: If your chocolate mix has firmed up a bit too much at this point, gently re-melt it over a very low heat.**

5.) Use the remaining mix to make your solid eggs. Pop the chocolate filled mould into the freezer until you get an egg craving.
