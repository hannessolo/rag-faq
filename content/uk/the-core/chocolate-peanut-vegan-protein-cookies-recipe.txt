INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1.) Preheat your oven to 180C.

2.) To make the cookies, combine the protein powder and cacao powder in a mixing bowl and stir, then add in the other ingredients and knead into a big ball.

3.) Split the mixture into around 10 small balls and shape each one into a flat round patty (around 1cm thick) with your hands.

4.) Place these on a lined baking tray and bake for ten minutes.

5.) Allow them to cool, then make the drizzle by mixing the ingredients in a bowl until you have a smooth chocolate.

6.) Drizzle this over the cookies using a spoon and finish with roasted peanuts for an extra protein punch!
