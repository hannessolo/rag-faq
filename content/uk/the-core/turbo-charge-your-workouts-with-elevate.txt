Life has a funny habit of getting in the way. Busy working lives and personal commitments can often leave us feeling tired and lethargic, and sometimes this can be a difficult routine to break.

But your training needn’t suffer as a result. Sometimes we don’t feel on the top of our game; we struggle to focus, we’re tired, we’d rather be doing other things – like not doing anything perhaps…and this is where a product like ELEVATE™ can prove invaluable.

### Introducing ELEVATE™

[ELEVATE](../../elevate.html "ELEVATE")™ is part of our Pro Series range of sports supplements and has received fantastic feedback since it was launched last year. Our product development team were set the task of creating the very best pre-workout supplement possible, regardless of the cost, and we’re confident that this is what we have delivered. It contains a staggering 13 active ingredients, all of which have been included in their purest forms and at their absolute optimal dosages to deliver the best workouts of your life.

### What our customers are saying

But don’t just take our word for it. Take a look at some of these reviews posted by our customers:

### **HOW IS ELEVATE™ DIFFERENT TO OTHER PRE-WORKOUTS?  
**

As with all of our products, the formulation for [ELEVATE](../../elevate.html "ELEVATE")™ is research-driven. It’s not simply about the ingredients contained in the product, it’s so much more than that. It’s about the synergy between these ingredients, and the quantities of each per serving.

And this is where we believe ELEVATE™ sets itself apart from other [pre-workout supplements](../../sports-nutrition/pre-workout.html "Pre-workout Supplements") on the market – it is 100% transparent. You know exactly what you are paying for. All too often brands hide behind proprietary blends, meaning you only get a glimpse of what is really in the product – the rest is guess work. Proprietary blends are almost always packed with inferior ingredients and fillers, because they are cheaper to produce. But you won’t get this from us. We aim to deliver the best products at the lowest prices, 100% of the time.

Every single batch of ELEVATE™ is tested for banned substances in an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory; under the renowned Informed Sport programme. As such, anyone using ELEVATE™, which ranges from elite athletes such as Olympic Gold Medallist James DeGale, to the casual gym-goer, has the absolute highest level of assurance that it is free of banned substances.

### **WHAT’S IN IT?**

ELEVATE™ is powered by a premium grade carbohydrate source in the form of [Vitargo](../../vitargo.html "Vitargo")® which, with its fast absorption rate rapidly supplies glycogen to the muscles prior to exercise.

[Beta Alanine](../../beta-alanine.html "Beta Alanine") is included to increase resistance to fatigue, effectively helping you train harder for longer.

[Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate](../../arginine-alpha-ketoglutarate.html "Arginine Alpha Ketoglutarate") (AAKG) helps boost nitric oxide levels which in turn increases blood flow and the subsequent delivery of nutrients to the muscles.

Citrulline Malate, well known for its impact on nitric oxide production, is also believed to help reduce muscle soreness after high volume training; great news if you are someone who suffers regularly from DOMS.

Caffeine, which is known to increase focus, is also shown to reduced perceived exertion. This increases your capacity to train harder.

Pre-workouts are a fantastic way to increase the focus and intensity of your training when you need a bit of a boost. Some people will use a pre-workout before each workout; others will take one as and when they feel like they need a lift. Try ELEVATE™ yourself – we’re confident you’ll notice an improvement in the quality of your workouts.
