_Discover how to include delicious almond butter in your everyday healthy diet._

What is almond butter?
----------------------

We’ve all heard of [peanut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut), but these days there is a whole new crop of [nut butters](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters) to try. And one of the tastiest, creamiest, and most nutritious is almond butter. As the name suggests, almond butter is pure almonds, ground into a creamy paste (the “butter” in the name refers to the spreadable consistency). But be careful – not all almond butter is created equal. For maximum taste and nutrition, choose almond butter that contains almonds and nothing else. Our [almond butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/roasted-almond-butter/bpf-abut) contains no sugar, salt, preservatives or palm oil. Just the way it should be!

Almond butter benefits
----------------------

Almond butter contains all the benefits of the whole almond, including vitamin E and magnesium. Almond butter contains the healthy monounsaturated fatty acids of the almonds, plus plant phytosterols and [antioxidants which promote heart health](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/antioxidant-rich-foods-supplements/). You’ll also get plenty of [healthy fibre](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/the-many-benefits-of-fibre-are-you-getting-enough/) (10g per 100g) and a great source of plant protein from almond butter (25g protein per 100g!) And there’s no need to restrict it to a mass gain diet. Almond butter can easily be incorporated into an everyday healthy eating plan – or even used when you’re dieting.

Almond butter nutrition
-----------------------

Exactly what are the macronutrients, calories, and nutritional benefits of almond butter? Let’s start with the simplest question: is almond butter actually good for you?

### Is almond butter healthy?

Almond butter is extremely healthy. In fact, the only potential downside is overconsumption (and we can’t help you with that one!). It’s a calorie-dense food – just like the raw almonds it is made from – but a little almond butter every day is an excellent way to [add extra vitamins](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/the-ultimate-guide-to-vitamins-and-minerals/), minerals, antioxidants, and fibre into your diet. Our almond butter is literally whole almonds, ground into a smooth paste. And you can’t get healthier than foods straight from nature.

### Is almond butter good for you?

Almond butter has a number of health benefits and is very good for you (it goes without saying that you should avoid it if you are allergic to almonds). Like the raw almonds it is made from, almond butter is heart-healthy (thanks to the vitamin E and plant antioxidants), a great source of [healthy fats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/why-are-healthy-fats-good-for-us/), and a good way to get more protein into your diet. Vegans and vegetarians can use almond butter as a protein source, but anyone can enjoy it as extra protein.

### How much protein in almond butter?

There’s an unbelievable 25g protein per 100g almond butter – yes, that means it is 25% protein! So even if you’re dieting and taking portion control seriously, you could still bump up your protein intake by over 6g protein with just 25g almond butter. If you’re on higher calories, bulking, or simply love to eat almond butter, you can get even more protein from this tasty snack! Imagine if you used almond butter instead of spread – what a great way to get extra protein in.

### How much almond butter per day?

You can’t overdose on almond butter, so the only restriction will be your own calorie intake. Just like [almonds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/whole-almonds/bpf-walm) themselves, it is a calorie-dense food. But if you can fit your desired amount of almond butter into your calorie intake, happy days! It’s a great choice for breakfast (as a topping for oats, in smoothies, on toast…), main meals, or snacks. Plenty of people enjoy it straight off the spoon!

### Calories in 100g almonds

Does almond butter have the same number of calories as the same weight of plain almonds? If you choose a natural almond butter (like ours) with absolutely nothing added – then it’s almost identical. Almonds clock in at 576 calories per 100g. Our natural, skin-on, roasted almond butter contains 612 calories per 100g. Are you a macro counter? Our almond butter has 55.8g fat, 5.9g carbs, and 25.1g per 100g. Work out how much of it you can get into your calorie goals and go for it.

Almond butter for muscle building
---------------------------------

Is almond butter a good food for muscle building and increasing lean mass? It’s a great source of [natural, plant protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/vegan-protein), which supports lean muscle mass. And it’s packed with fibre, to help maintain healthy digestion and aid the absorption of other nutrients. Plus, it has so many key vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that it will help your body stay healthy and energised as you train hard.

### How many almonds to eat per day bodybuilding

Almonds have been a go-to nut in bodybuilders’ diets for decades. This is probably because they are so high in protein, a great source of fibre, and a way to get those important healthy fats into your diet. Almonds also contain the highest amount of calcium of any nut and have a lot of [magnesium](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/magnesium-bisglycinate-tablets/bpb-magb-0000) (an important mineral which can be depleted through heavy amounts of training). If you’re a bodybuilder, there’s no set number of almonds to eat per day. But they’re certainly a healthy and nutritious choice to add into your diet.

Almond butter taste
-------------------

So, the big question – just how good does all-natural almond butter taste (and how many different ways can you use it?).

### Almond butter taste vs peanut butter

Does almond butter taste like peanut butter? [We don’t think so](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/peanut-butter-vs-almond-butter/). It has a similar texture – smooth, creamy, rich and delicious. But the taste is completely different – as you would imagine since the two nut butters are made from different raw ingredients. Almond butter has a milder taste than peanut butter, and we think that makes it even more versatile.

### What goes well with almond butter?

How can you eat our almond butter? The only limit is your imagination! For breakfast, try it spooned on top of your protein oats, or mixed into a smoothie. It’s great as a spread on toast or a bagel (with or without other toppings). With main meals, almond butter can be used as an ingredient in sauces and marinades for meat (think [satay sauce with a twist](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/vegan-satay-dip-recipe/)), or simply eaten alongside your meal as a great source of healthy fats. It’s good as a snack, too, spread on rice cakes or added into Greek yoghurt with fruit or berries. Or try smearing almond butter onto the sliced apple. We think it’s especially good just before bed as a source of slow-release protein. Try it on top of a protein mug cake!

How to make roasted almond butter
---------------------------------

Here’s how we make our almond butter. First, we source high-quality raw almonds, which are roasted with the skin off. The plain roasted almonds are then gently crushed and slowly blended into a smooth buttery paste – with nothing added (no salt, sugar, palm oil or preservatives). You could make your own roasted almond butter – but why bother when we’ve done the hard work for you? Check out our best-selling [Almond Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/roasted-almond-butter/bpf-abut) or try our [Dark Chocolate Roasted Almond Butter.](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dark-chocolate-almond-butter/bpf-abut-dcho)
