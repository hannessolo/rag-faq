**[Collagen supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/collagen)** come in different forms such as powders and capsules. In this quick guide, we’ll take a look at the most popular types of collagen including collagen coffee.

What is Collagen?
-----------------

First things first. Essentially, collagen is what holds us together and it’s the main element that makes up for our connective tissue. It accounts for a third of the proteins in our body and is present in our skin, hair, nails, joints, muscles and bones. It’s really everywhere.

When it comes to skin specifically, collagen is the key player that maintains plumpness and elasticity. The only downside is that as we get older, collagen production slows down. Of course, that doesn’t impact skin only but all areas in which collagen is involved such as joints. Integrating collagen supplements can support with normal collagen production as we’re less capable of producing it.

Collagen Supplements
--------------------

Choosing collagen for skin, hair and connective tissue has become increasingly popular as new studies develop. Most formulas contain hydrolysed collagen as it’s considered to be the fastest form absorbed by the body.

As most collagen products are created with chicken cartilage or bovine hides, it can be extremely difficult for vegetarians or vegans to use these supplements. Because different formulas contain different types of collagen, it’s always worth checking out the ingredient list to make sure the supplement is compatible with your diet.

### Collagen Powder

In its powder form, collagen is often combined with Vitamin C. That’s because it plays a key role in the production of collagen in our bodies and without sufficient amounts, our bodies can’t form or store the protein. Plus, Vitamin C can support different aspects of skin maintenance thanks to its well-known antioxidant properties.

You can easily add collagen powders to your favourite drinks. This is probably one of the most versatile ways of integrating it.

### Collagen Tablets and Capsules

Collagen tablets and soft capsules are another popular way of introducing collagen. If you’re not a fan of flavoured drinks, they’re a no-brainer and very simple way of boosting your intake. For example, most dosages suggest 1 you take one capsule each day. That way, it’ll easily fit into your routine.

### Collagen Coffee

If you want to make your morning routine as seamless as possible, collagen coffee might be the ultimate option. You can get all the benefits of caffeine and collagen all in one go without having to take separate capsules or powders.

All you need to do is grab your favourite coffee mug, add coffee and hot water, give it a stir and you’re good to go and start your day.
