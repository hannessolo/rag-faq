You’ve heard the ‘term all-singing, all-dancing’, but now it’s time to see it in action. Our  **[Informed Whey® Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/informed-whey/bpps-iwhe)** is the best of the best (if we do say so ourselves). And we’re going to tell you all the reasons why this product might just become your new best training buddy. 

First things first though. Why are we talking about a line of products that we are known for? This is nothing new (I hear you say). Well this is where you’re mistaken. It’s time for a new flavour launch. Many customers already know, use and love this product. And for good reason. So we’ve created two new flavours to get those taste buds tingling. Our new Chocolate Millionaires Shortbread and Chocolate Peanut Butter flavours are ready. Seriously, it doesn’t get better than this. For now anyway.

**Why choose Informed Whey® Protein?**
--------------------------------------

Aside from these being the most luxurious flavours since Double Chocolate, there is much more to this training partner than a flash name. A whole host of high-quality ingredients make this superior shake taste incredible, while helping take your training to another level. It’s a step up from other **[protein shakes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein)**.

Firstly, it contains our mTOR Whey Complex™. This is a mixture of **[whey protein isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-isolate-90/bpb-wpi9-0000)** (65%) and whey protein concentrate (35%). Unlike most other whey formulas, it uses [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) isolate as the primary protein source. This gives you the most protein possible per serving, while maintaining that deliciously creamy taste and texture. 

Informed Whey® Protein also contains 3g glutamine and 3g leucine per serving. Both of these are amino acids that have been shown as important to take after intense exercise. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in our muscles, and supplementing this has shown improvement in post-workout recovery. Leucine, on the other hand, is a great supplement to promote protein synthesis. These are both optimally dosed at 3g each per serving.

Another call out is the added  DigeZyme® and LactoSpore®. These added extras are the kings of digestion aids. DigeZyme® is a blend of five digestive enzymes that help to break down food in the stomach. As we know, a little help in this area goes a long way. LactoSpore® is a high-quality source of Bacillus coagulans, a well known probiotic. Each serving has a whopping 60,000,000 spores (in other words, that’s a great deal of goodness).
