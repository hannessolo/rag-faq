Kate Farley is a boxer that redefines what it means to be a fighter. Kate has cerebral palsy, which affects her muscles and coordination skills. She was inspired to take up boxing after the 2016 Olympics, and since then has trained five times a week.

Boxing has changed Kate’s life, and we wanted to take that one step further. Kate has always dreamed of meeting her hero, Anthony Joshua. So we made it happen.

We set up an interview with Kate, talking to her about her experience of training and where she hopes boxing can take her, then we brought out Anthony Joshua.

After getting over the shock, it didn’t take long for Kate and AJ to get the gloves on and get in the ring.

In amongst the sparring, they spoke about what motivates them, some of the challenges they’ve faced, and how AJ is feeling about his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr. in December.

If you’re as inspired by Kate’s story as we are, make sure you share the video on social media.
