If she was a book she’d be the world’s largest recipe encyclopedia and people would gaze upon her in awe of her creations. Such knowledge and creativity in one book is perhaps something the world is not quite ready for…

In the meantime, if you need some fab recipes ideas, why not try this **Vanilla Frosted Protein Cupcakes** recipe, courtesy of The Muscle Bakery? For additional inspiration, give [The Muscle Bakery baking book](http://themusclebakery.com/shop/#!/MUSCLE-BAKING-Volume-01-Paperback/p/57396057/category=0) a look too.

### Instructions:

1.) Pre-heat oven to 170 Degrees C.

2.) Mix all your ingredients in a bowl, mix wet ingredients first, then fold in dry ingredients, leaving baking soda and vinegar till last.

3.) Add approx. 2-2.5 tbsps of mix per muffin mould, if you add more they may overflow while baking (and morph into alien type muffins).

4.) Bake for 15 minutes approx. until golden over the top but soft and springy to the touch.

5.) Leave to cool completely before frosting.

6.) For frosting, add 2 scoops **casein** first then the yoghurt. (Depending on what brand of casein and yoghurt you use, you may or may not need the 3rd scoop.) You will need a thick consistency that wont run when you frost.

7.) Using a disposable piping bag and nozzle of whichever shape you most prefer, start frosting the cupcakes. A steady hand is of course helpful!

8.) Then, hide them away… because everyone gonna want one!
