James DeGale will be looking to make history
--------------------------------------------

BULK POWDERS™ athlete [James DeGale](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/bulkpowders-james-degale-formalise-partnership/ "James DeGale") will be looking to make history on 25th April 2015, when he fights for the [IBF super-middleweight world title](http://www.boxing.com/ranking "Boxing Rankings") at London’s O2 Arena. James, who won Olympic Gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is attempting to become the first British boxer to win both an Olympic Gold Medal and a Professional World Title.

### Froch chose to relinquish the belt

The IBF Title has become vacant after Carl Froch chose to relinquish the belt rather than face James, his mandatory challenger. James secured his position as mandatory by knocking out previously undefeated Brandon Gonzales in May at Wembley Stadium. He followed that up with an explosive performance, knocking out former world title challenger Marco Antonio Periban in November.

### “I’m really excited to be boxing for the world title.”

James can now set his sights on preparing for his headline appearance on 25th April. James said, “I’m really excited to be boxing for the world title and making history. Training camp has started and the world title at the end of it is providing extra motivation for the tough sessions.” BULK POWDERS™ asked James if he’d have rather fought Carl Froch for the belt, and he replied, “In an ideal world, yes. Really though, it doesn’t matter. I just want to get my hands on the IBF belt and I’ll fight anyone to achieve that.”

### “The products certainly play their part.”

BULK POWDERS™ have been supporting James throughout his gruelling training camps, with the highest quality [sports nutrition](https://www.bulk.com/uk "Sports Nutrition"). James commented, “The products certainly play their part. When you’re training 2-3 times per day, the main thing I notice is better recovery. That helps put that bit more into each session, which makes a difference come fight night.”

Everyone at BULK POWDERS™ wishes James every success for his world title fight!
