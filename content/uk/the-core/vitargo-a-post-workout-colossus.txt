What is post-workout nutrition?
-------------------------------

Post-workout nutrition is often considered as the best time to refuel for optimum nutrient delivery and recovery. You only have to take a look around your gym or sports club as people are finishing their sessions to notice. The treadmill has bearly stopped revolving, and the weight plates are still vibrating on the floor, but the protein shakes have already been glugged down in a frantic effort to regenerate body tissue like The Terminator.

### No ‘One-Size-Fits-All’

Much is said about the timing of post-workout nutrition, but it’s not only the timing that is important, but the nutrients are also important too. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to supplementation. When and what you take should always depend on what your fitness goals are.

### Fast Release Carbohydrate

For the purpose of this article, we’ll take a closer look at [Vitargo®](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitargo/bpb-vigo-0000 "Vitargo"), a relatively unsung hero in the category of fast release carbohydrates, the primary macronutrient for rapid glycogen replenishment when the body is low on energy stores. Vitargo® is a patented molecular carbohydrate derived from barley starch. The thing that makes Vitargo® so unique is its extraction technique, which is different from other starch-based carbohydrates. The osmolality, molecular weight and ‘branching’ are also key.

3 reasons why Vitargo® should be your post-workout carb of choice
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Vitargo® has a low osmolality which means that less water is drawn into the stomach as it is digested – helping to reduce bloating and increase rapid absorption.
2.  Vitargo® also has a high degree of branching. This ‘branching’ of Vitargo® allows it to be digested and enter the bloodstream much faster (up to 2 times) than conventional carbohydrates.
3.  Vitargo® has been shown to increase the rate & speed of insulin secretion following exhaustive exercise. Insulin, a vital component of muscle building, opens up muscle cells to take in glucose, [amino acids](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids "Amino Acids") and important nutrients, but also acts as an anti-catabolic hormone, helping to reduce muscle breakdown.
