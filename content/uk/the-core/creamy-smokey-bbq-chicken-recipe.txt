Chicken. Smokey Barbecue flavoured Protein Peanut Butter. Creamy Sauce. It doesn’t get much better than that. Get your creative juices flowing by trying this smokey BBQ chicken recipe by The Muscle Bakery, packed full of protein with less than 400 calories. Winner.

### Instructions

1.) In a large non stick pan, heat up your coconut oil on medium heat until melted and add your chicken breast and onion salt.  
2.) While the chicken is cooking, dissolve your stock cube in a little bit of water and pour that in – dissolve it in a 1/8 cup of boiling water.  
3.) Stir the chicken and leave to cook in chicken broth for a further couple of minutes.  
4.) Add the Greek Yoghurt and stir well.  
5.) Add Smokey Barbecue Nuts About Whey™ (high protein peanut butter) and stir well.  
6.) Bring down the heat one notch and leave to simmer for about 10 minutes.  
7.) Finish off with a garnish of chilli flakes and your favourite side dish!

This is the basic recipe for **4 servings**. If you want to add more herbs and spices to suit your tastes go ahead!

If you want it to be more peanuty, add some powdered peanut butter or a bit of Roasted [Natural Peanut Butter](../../peanut-butter.html)! OR, if you want to go REALLY crazy, top with crispy bacon! YUM!
