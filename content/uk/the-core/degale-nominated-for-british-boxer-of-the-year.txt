BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale has been nominated for the prestigious British Boxer of the Year award at  the annual British Boxing Board of Control Awards. The awards ceremony takes place in Hammersmith on Friday September 25th.

In May, James travelled to America to win the IBF World Title, beating the talented Andre Dirrell. James’ victory made him the first boxer to win both an Olympic Gold Medal for Great Britain and a professional world title. James put in an impressive performance, including dropping Dirrell twice in the second round. James’ previous fight was a 3rd round knock-out victory over former world title challenger Marco Antonio Periban. Before this fight, Periban had never been stopped and boasted a draw on his record with current WBC champion Badou Jack (who beat George Groves).

It has been a great 12 months for James and he’s looking forward to an even more successful next 12 months, both defending and unifying titles in the Super Middleweight division.
