Safety and transparency in sports nutrition
===========================================

The recent shocking news of doping allegations within the athletics community has raised questions amongst many people about sports supplements. Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson all deny intentionally consuming any banned substances. Tyson Gay has been quoted as saying “I basically put my trust in someone and was let down”. This may lead some to believe he was given the banned substance by somebody he trusted without knowing it was a banned.

Questions have been raised amongst those who use supplements who are not fully aware of what is in the product they are using. Consumers may be concerned about ingredients in products, safety and legality. We hope to provide you with some answers to these questions and help place your trust in our products.

**Bulk™** is a sports supplement company that is very transparent. Products on our website clearly display the full list of ingredients and dosages which means you know exactly what you are getting and in what amounts.

Some critics have suggested that only sports accredited supplements should be used but this limits you to only a small number of supplements. It’s also costly for sports nutrition companies to get the products accredited so not all companies and products which are legal in sports are on the list. With a little reading and a look at the [WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) list of prohibited substances and methods.](http://www.wada-ama.org/en/world-anti-doping-program/sports-and-anti-doping-organizations/international-standards/prohibited-list/ "WADA 2013 List of Prohibited Substances and Methods") This can allow you to trust our products and feel safe when buying from us.

We hope you feel comfortable using our products and will continue to shop from our diverse range.
