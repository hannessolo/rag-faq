As part of their 2023 **[Sports Nutrition Awards](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a40932512/sports-nutrition-awards/)**, [**Men’s Health**](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/g43617423/best-protein-powders/) recruited a panel of over 200 fitness enthusiasts and industry experts and asked them to put a variety of [**protein powders**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein) to the test. After four weeks of rigorous testing, our [**Informed Whey®**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/informed-whey/bpps-iwhe) was awarded the ‘best protein powder for athletes’.

Here we talk more about why we were awarded this, take a look at what Men’s Health, as well as what customers say.

**Best protein powder for athletes**
------------------------------------

**Informed Whey®** is designed for professional athletes and serious trainers. It’s produced to the highest standards using ingredients from industry-leading manufacturers, and every batch is tested for banned substances in an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory under the renowned [**Informed Sport**](https://sport.wetestyoutrust.com/) programme

We also test every batch with a separate independent laboratory to verify its nutritional content, paying close attention to protein levels. If a batch doesn’t meet our rigorous standards, we reject it. If you’re serious about your training regime, **Informed Whey®** is the whey protein formula for you.

Our formula is designed to be the best whey protein shake money can buy, created in compliance with international competition standards for professional athletes. We test every single batch for banned substances and impurities, list every ingredient in detail, and rigorously test it for nutritional consistency. That means total transparency, so you know exactly how you’re fuelling your body.

**What did Men’s Health say about Informed Whey?**
--------------------------------------------------

_“Geared specifically towards athletes, each batch of this powder is lab tested for banned substances and accredited under the independent Informed Sport quality assurance programme for sports nutrition products. If you’re someone who competes and is subject to drug testing, opt for a product with this label._

**_Informed Whey®_** _contains 24g of whey isolate protein per 30g serving and is packed with 3g of leucine and 3g of glutamine peptides. It’s also low in calories, carbs and fat, making a solid option as a lean source of protein.”_

AJ takes a number of top-tier products in the [**Informed Sport range**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/informed-sport). All these products have undergone rigorous testing to ensure they are free from banned substances, providing professional athletes like AJ with complete confidence in the quality and legitimacy of their supplements. It’s no wonder AJ has used them for so long.

“During camp I can train up to three times a day so getting the right nutrition on board is vital. A blend of protein and carbohydrate shakes help me recover and give me the energy to keep training. I have **Informed Whey®** before training or with my breakfast and [**Aftermath™**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/aftermath/bpps-amat) after training for recovery.”
