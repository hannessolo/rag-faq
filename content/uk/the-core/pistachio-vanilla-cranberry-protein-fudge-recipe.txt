Nuts about pistachio and partial to a bit of fudge? Why not try your hand at this Pistachio, Vanilla & Cranberry Protein Fudge recipe? It’s quick to make; simply mix up the ingredients and pop it in the freezer. Perfect as an easy treat that will (potentially) last a long time…or until you’ve devoured it.

### Instructions
