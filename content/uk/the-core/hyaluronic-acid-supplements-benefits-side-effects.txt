What is Hyaluronic Acid?
------------------------

Hyaluronic acid might sound scary, but it’s actually an all-natural compound that’s highly beneficial to skin, hair and connective tissue. We already have hyaluronic acid in our bodies (particularly in the joints, eyes, and other areas with lots of fluid) where it helps the body retain collagen. So why take hyaluronic acid as a supplement? It can be incredibly beneficial for skin and hair health, and for [easing joint disorders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/joint-care.html).

You might know about hyaluronic acid as a skincare ingredient, where it is prized for the ability to plump and moisturise skin. But what can it do for your insides?

As a supplement, hyaluronic acid lubricates the joints and other soft tissue and can even help the body heal from injury.

Hyaluronic Acid Benefits
------------------------

There are plenty of reasons to add [hyaluronic acid](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hyaluronic-acid-tablets-150mg/bpb-haci-0000) to your supplement stack.

Hyaluronic acid can boost skin suppleness, which can help your body cope with training – especially if your goal is adding mass. Avoid stretch marks and get that smooth, supple look to your physique (and build a great base for your tan, if you intend on competing!).

It can also speed up recover from injury, whether that’s cuts and grazes or damage to soft tissue and joints. Oral hyaluronic acid supplements – like our [Hyaluronic Acid Tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hyaluronic-acid-tablets-150mg/bpb-haci-0000) – boost the levels of hyaluronic acid in the skin.

One of the most exciting benefits of hyaluronic acid is for bones, joints, and connective tissue. Our bodies have lots of hyaluronic acid in the joints, where it cushions bones and keeps everything well lubricated. This has clear benefits for anyone who trains, helping you lift, run, and move without restriction or pain. If you worry about degenerative joint disease like osteoarthritis, hyaluronic acid should be part of your supplement stack, to [minimise the impact of wear and tear on your joints](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/joint-care.html).

Hyaluronic acid may also slow the rate of bone loss and increase the activity of osteoblasts (cells which build new bone tissue). Everyone should care about bone health, but this benefit will be especially interesting for women who are at higher risk of osteoporosis and bone loss. [Whey protein hydrolysate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hydrolysed-whey-protein-isolate/bpb-hwpi-0000) is another food source to consider when thinking about bone health.

Hyaluronic Acid Liquid vs Tablets
---------------------------------

Hyaluronic acid can be taken in several ways. It’s present in skincare as liquid form, and it can be administered via injection as a liquid. But the easiest way to take it is in pill form, like in our Hyaluronic Acid Tablets.

Hyaluronic Acid Side Effects
----------------------------

There have been very few reported side effects of hyaluronic acid. Remember, it’s a totally natural compound (the name “acid” is kind of misleading, as it isn’t harsh or damaging!). It’s wise to use caution if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, but that goes for most supplements. People with cancer or a history of cancer should avoid using hyaluronic acid, because there is some evidence that cancer cells may be sensitive to it.

Which Foods Contain Hyaluronic Acid?
------------------------------------

Why not boost your body’s hyaluronic acid through your diet? Bone broth is a natural source of hyaluronic acid. By simmering animal bones for 24 hours or more, the hyaluronic acid (and other nutrients) are extracted and mixed into the water, which you can then drink.

Which Foods Promote Hyaluronic Acid?
------------------------------------

Other healthy foods can help increase your body’s natural ability to produce hyaluronic acid. Soy foods (like edamame beans and tofu) may help your body produce more hyaluronic acid, and they are also a great source of [plant-based protein for vegans](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/vegan-protein). Some experts think root veggies like potatoes and sweet potatoes can increase the body’s levels of hyaluronic acid. Chances are you eat these anyway, so crack on! Citrus fruits all contain a compound called naringenin, which reduce the rate at which your body’s hyaluronic acid breaks down. Other foods that may do this are tomatoes and bananas. And foods high in magnesium – like leafy greens, nuts, seeds, and avocado – will help the body produce more hyaluronic acids. Sounds like a good excuse for a mega superfood salad.
