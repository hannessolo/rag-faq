Eat your greens they say! It’s not your typical combination – but why don’t you try these delicious Spinach infused Banana pancakes by [The Muscle Bakery](https://themusclebakery.com/). Made with our very own Soya Protein Isolate 90, providing 22.6g protein per serving.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.) Add all the ingredients into a high speed blender (we used a NutriBullet) and set aside for about 5 minutes. You need to let it set so that the chia seeds get to work and soak up some of the moisture.

Note: If you like your pancakes thick and chunky, the recipe as above will make them like that, however if you prefer thinner ones, just add more water or milk.

2.) Prepare a non-stick pan with a dab of [coconut oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html) or coconut oil spray and turn hob heat onto medium.

3.) Start by pouring a spoonful of batter with a tablespoon and cook for several minutes. Then, flip over gently using a spatula and let cook for another several minutes.

4.) Then, drizzle your [favourite sauce](https://www.bulk.com/uk/zero-calorie-syrup.html), fruit or even [nut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters.html) and enjoy these delicately moist pancakes!

Yields 2 servings.
