Instructions
------------

1.) In a high speed blender pour in cashews, agave and LiquiFlav™ and blend until combined.

2.) Pour in protein powder, peanut butter and blitz again until combined.

3.) Pour mix into a suitable ice-cream mould and leave to freeze overnight.

4.) Once set, remove from moulds and coat in melted dark chocolate, decorating with toppings of preference.

I used chocolate sprinkles and a chopped up a Vegan Protein Bar, banana flavour.

5.) You can use this base recipe to make any flavour, plus it works without the protein powder if you prefer.
