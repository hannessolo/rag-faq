When your muscles ache, your willpower to stick to your diet begins to fade and your feet just don’t seem to want to take you to the gym, don’t fight it. Instead, head home and stick on a film. But not just any film. Pick one from our list of truly inspirational films and get that motivation back. So powerful is the art of cinema that you shouldn’t be surprised if you find yourself springing up from your chair and busting out reps whilst the credits roll.

Welcome to Part #1 of our Top 10 Motivational Movies. Part #2 will be coming next week.

300 (2006)
----------

The movie version of Frank Miller’s graphic novel about the 300 hundred Spartans who take on an army of 300,000 Persian soldiers is one hell of a film. Not only does the courage and fearlessness of the Spartan warriors inspire you, but their upbringing of fighting with wolves puts to shame our childhood memories of gameboys. To become especially motivated, watch this film with female company. After the almost constant mentions of ‘how amazing Gerard Butlers body is’ you’ll be off down the gym to hone your body in the image of some Scottish bloke who shouts ‘SPARTANNNNNS!’ a lot.

Gladiator (2000)
----------------

Another revenge fuelled film, Ridley Scott’s portrayal of the Roman Empire at the height of its power is a testosterone fuelled frenzy of fighting, guaranteed to make you rise from your sofa in glory. Roman general-turned-gladiator Maximus Decimus Meridius is not only a battlefield legend, destroying pretty much everyone who comes his way on his quest to avenge his family, but he also delivers some truly inspirational speeches on his way to serving a plateful of revenge to an emperor who stole the throne and killed his family.

Rocky (1976)
------------

The underdog film that started it all – the mould for The Karate Kid and many more – Rocky is the original and ultimate inspirational workout film. In case, for some ridiculous reason you haven’t seen it, it tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a small time fighter who gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship. The film not only turned Sylvester Stallone into a major star, but it also made over $117 million, won three Oscars and had five sequels. Everything about Rocky has become synonymous with working out, so stick on ‘Gonna Fly Now’ by Bill Conti and ‘Eye Of The Tiger’ by Survivor (yes, we know it’s Rocky III, but what a workout song) and get pumped!

Pumping Iron (1977)
-------------------

Although not a Hollywood blockbuster, this documentary brought bodybuilding into the mainstream and for that we bow down to praise it. A look behind the scenes at the 1975 IFBB Mr. Universe and Mr. Olympia competitions, the film is centred around the competition between an unknown Arnold Schwarzenegger and his main rival for the title of Mr. Olympia, Lou Ferrigno. This was the film that made Arnie a household name, thus beating any other Arnie films to be on this list. Watching the devotion that these guys have to their bodybuilding, which at the time offered little chance of fame or reward, is pretty inspiring stuff.

Braveheart (1995)
-----------------

Back in 1995, when Mel Gibson donned a kilt and some face paint to become the Scottish warrior William Wallace, he was on top form. Wallace rebels against the invading English, leading a Scottish army during the first war of Scottish independence. He inspires the eventual battle that wins the Scots their freedom, and freedom becomes one of the most inspirational messages of the film – surely Mel Gibson is just as infamous for drink driving as he is for the immortal line “You may take our lives, but you’ll never take our freedom!”. It’s one of the best pre-battle movie speeches of all time, and you’d have to be made of stone not to feel inspired after it.

That’s five movies down with five more to come. Watch these motivational classics with a [Toffee Popcorn flavoured Pure Whey Protein™ shake](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html "Toffee Popcorn Pure Whey Protein") for the ultimate cinematic experience.
