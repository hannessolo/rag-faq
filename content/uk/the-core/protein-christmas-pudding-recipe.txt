### Summary

Christmas wouldn’t be complete without a piece of Christmas Pudding, but not everyone is a fan of the traditional recipe. Here is a different twist on things, our very own Protein Christmas Pudding,  incorporating some of our Mince Pie Pure Whey Protein and Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Butter. Feast on this dessert for massive post Christmas dinner gains.

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 160C and boil the kettle.

2.) In a small sauce pan, combine the first set of ingredients. Bring to the boil and simmer for 4 minutes. Allow to cool for a minute or so and stir in the second lot of ingredients.

3.) In a small bowl, combine the final lot of ingredients. Stir into the mixture in the saucepan. It will be thick. Dollop the mixture into your mini pudding mould, press down and flatten.

4.) Take a square of foil and a square of baking paper. Make a pleat in the middle and fold, as you would do for a normal Christmas pudding. Cover the top of the pudding mould with this and tie with string to secure. Place in a roasting tin in the oven and pour the boiling water into the tin until it is about half way up the pudding mould. Steam for 45-50 minutes. Leave to cool fully, unless eating straight away of course! Although as with all Christmas puddings, they improve as they ‘mature’.
