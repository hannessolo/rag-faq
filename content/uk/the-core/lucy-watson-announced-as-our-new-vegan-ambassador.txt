Established influencer and champion of animal rights, [Lucy Watson](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/qa-with-lucy-watson/) has today become a BULK POWDERS® Ambassador, representing our Vegan range of Sports Nutrition products. As brand ambassador Lucy will benefit from world class nutritional products to help her reap the full rewards of a plant-based diet.

As a fitness fanatic & long-time vegan, Lucy is passionate about maintaining a healthy diet that will push her to peak performance in the gym and keep her in great shape.

For vegans, consuming enough protein to support an active lifestyle can prove difficult due to limited protein sources. Luckily, BULK POWDERS® is here to help. The range of [Vegan Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/vegan-protein.html) powders and foods, which includes products such as [Pea Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/super-pea-protein-isolate.html), [Hemp Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/hemp-protein.html), and [Chia Seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chia-seeds.html), makes sure whatever your diet, you can still access the highest quality protein supplements available.

Of the partnership, Lucy Watson said: “I’m really pleased to be working with BULK POWDERS® – they are one of the rare brands to offer a wide and varied range of vegan options, and this is a subject close to my heart. I’m always on-the-go so it’s amazing to know I can rely on BULK POWDERS® to incorporate the protein I need into my diet, quickly and easily. I’m a keen foodie, so I am already thinking up delicious recipes to go with the range.”

With four key ranges, encapsulating the [Pro](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/pro-series.html), [Pure](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/pure-series.html) and [Complete Series](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/complete-series.html), as well as [Vegan Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/vegan-protein.html), BULK POWDERS® has it all and simply will not be beaten on price, quality or service – and now has the Lucy Watson seal of approval.

Lucy Watson joins Tom Daley as the latest BULK POWDERS® Ambassador, with more activity on the horizon helping to highlight the benefits of the right Sports Nutrition.
