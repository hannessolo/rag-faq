If you want a simple, no bake tasty treat, then look no further! These Chocolate Hazelnut Fudge Bites are just that, and vegan too!

Instructions
------------

1.) Melt the coconut oil by placing it in a bowl over a saucepan half full of water on a medium heat on the hob until it melts (if you stir while melting it it will be quicker).

2.) Pour the oil into a bowl and add in the other ingredients.

3.) Stir well until you have a thick chocolatey mixture (try not to eat it all already!), then pour this into a baking tray or mould (I used an 8″ loaf mould lined with baking paper for quite thick slices but you can use a bigger tray if you want thinner ones).

4.) Sprinkle with chopped hazelnuts if you like, then pop the fudge in the freezer for about four hours to set.

5.) Cut into squares and enjoy!
