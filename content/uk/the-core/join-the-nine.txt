Many people set new year goals, but our research shows only nine percent of you will see it through.

You may think you’re ready to smash every session, never miss a workout, and completely transform your health in just a few weeks. You tell yourself, _this is the year I really stick to my plan._

But then February rolls around and you’re already struggling with motivation. Sound familiar?

You’re not alone.

Research shows that only nine percent of people who set gym-related resolutions actually achieve their goals.

But why do so many fall short? 

*   **13% quit by the end of January** — the initial motivation fades fast
*   **45% say they’re too busy** — life gets in the way
*   **23% give up because they don’t see results fast enough** — impatience takes over
*   **18% don’t set the right targets** — unrealistic goals cause frustration

There are a variety of reasons why you might quit. Here’s how you can break past those barriers and be part of the NINE% that achieve their goals.

**The power of motivation: Find your “why”**

Motivation is the fuel that gets you started. But to sustain it, you need a reason to hit the gym when you don’t really feel like going. Write down your “why” and keep it somewhere visible. 

Just over half of men want to build muscle, whereas 57% of women aim to lose weight. Whatever your goal, remind yourself of it every time you feel like giving up. Pair this with small, achievable milestones to celebrate along the way. That may be lifting 5KG more after a month or learning about sustainable weight loss targets. Every victory, no matter how small, reinforces your motivation.

### **Tips to keep going when you’re losing motivation**

Staying consistent isn’t about being perfect—it’s about finding ways to keep showing up. Here are some tips to keep you in the game:

*   **Create a routine:** Commit to specific days and times for your workouts. Treat them like unmissable appointments.
*   **Buddy up:** Exercising with a friend or joining a fitness class adds accountability and makes workouts more enjoyable. Both men and women are around 40% more likely to keep going with a partner holding them accountable.
*   **Prioritise sports nutrition:** You’re four times more likely to succeed if you have sports nutrition at least three times per week. When you’re failing to see the results you want, a lack of the right nutrition is probably the reason. Protein and creatine play a huge role in building muscle, whilst pre-workout fires you up for every session. Get the right products and you’ll see the best results. 
*   **Track your progress:** Whether it’s reps, muscle, or how you feel, tracking progress makes men 46% more likely to keep going. 

### **It’s OK to miss a day (or week)**

Life happens. Whether it’s work, family obligations, or sheer exhaustion, there will be days when you can’t make it to the gym. Missing a workout isn’t failure—it’s an opportunity to reset.

The key is not letting one missed day snowball into a missed week or month. Acknowledge that rest and recovery are essential parts of fitness and will help you stay consistent in the long run.

### **Be the NINE%**

Achieving your New Year’s fitness resolution isn’t about being perfect, it’s about being consistent. Find a routine that works for you, allow yourself to rest when life gets in the way, and reward yourself whenever you get those small wins.
