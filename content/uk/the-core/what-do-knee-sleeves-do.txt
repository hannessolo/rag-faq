Are you looking to improve your heavy leg lifts? If so, [Knee Sleeves](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/knee-sleeves/bace-ksle) are an essential bit of kit that not only benefits your performance, but protects you from injury too. In this article, we’ll detail exactly what knee sleeves do, what they’re made of and where to get them.

**What are knee sleeves?**
--------------------------

Knee sleeves are ergogenic aids used by powerlifters to improve performance during heavy compound lifts, primarily squats. They tend to be made of materials such as Neoprene, which is strong and malleable. Knee sleeves are allowed in powerlifting competition, so it’s not seen as an unfair advantage to use them.

**What do knee sleeves do?**
----------------------------

Knee sleeves provide compression to the knee joint. Compression increases blood flow to the area, allowing the knees to stay ‘warm’. They also help to stabilise the knee joint in movements like squats, improving stability and power during the lift.

### **Support**

Knee sleeves provide support for the knee joint, limiting patella movement without restricting your range of motion. Knee sleeves also help to stabilise the knee joint in movements like squats, reducing discomfort at the bottom of the movement, just prior to concentric contraction.

Knee sleeves also improve proprioception. This is a fancy world for your bodily awareness – your ability to sense the action of your knees. This helps to create proper alignment during your lift, thus maintaining clean and consistent form.

### **Compression**

Alongside stability and support, knee sleeves provide compression. The squeeze from compression increases blood flow to the area, allowing the knees to stay warm and ready for lifting.

### **Recovery**

A 2020 study found that compression stockings (a fun name for knee sleeves) improved the lifting performance, as expected. But they also discovered how they [benefit muscle fatigue and muscle soreness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985982/) post-exercise. In essence, knee sleeves help to reduce recovery time. 

**Benefits of knee sleeves**
----------------------------

*   Support – stabilises the knee joint, improving strength and performance
*   Compression – increases blood flow to the area, allowing the knees to stay ‘warm’ during a movement. 
*   Recovery – reduces recovery time, meaning you can train more frequently. 

**When should I use knee sleeves?**
-----------------------------------

Heavy compound lifts that use the knees. The obvious one is heavy squats, which sees the knee undergo full contraction and extension, all with a heavy load. They are also used for log lifts, as this requires a sharp leg press and extension in order to be a legitimate lift. 

**Difference between knee sleeves and knee wraps**
--------------------------------------------------

Knee sleeves are not the same as knee wraps. Sleeves are put on over the foot and pulled up to the knee, while wraps are a long strip that is spiralled around the joint. 

Knee sleeves are generally more versatile than knee wraps since you can wear sleeves throughout your workout. Wrapping your knees is sturdier, and is a much bulkier process. The appropriate word is ‘annoying’.

Despite being an ordeal to get on, knee wraps can significantly boost your squat numbers. If you’re very experienced and breaking them out for your heaviest lifts, you should consider trying wraps. Knee wraps. Not like, fajitas. 

**What knee sleeve thickness should I get?**
--------------------------------------------

Knee sleeve thickness is measured in mm. The thicker the stronger, but also the more restrictive. 

5mm and 7mm knee sleeves are recommended for lifters, such as powerlifters or weightlifters. 3mm sleeves provide less support, but are lighter and less intrusive. This makes them ideal for endurance athletes, such as runners. 

**Where can I get knee sleeves?**
---------------------------------

[SBD](https://sbdapparel.com/) provides best in class equipment, selling both knee wraps and knee sleeves. Elite lifters or competing powerlifters will look to these kinds of brands, who specialise in providing competition-compliant sleeves, ready for meets. They’re expensive, but worth it for those competing. 

However, if you are looking for good quality sleeves and a good price, our [Premium Knee Sleeves](https://www.bulk.com/uk/knee-sleeves.html) are a good mid-range opinion for your day-to-day sessions.
