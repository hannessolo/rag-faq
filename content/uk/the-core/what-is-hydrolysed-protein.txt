One of our product favourites is our [Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hydrolysed-whey-protein-isolate/bpb-hwpi-0000), which contains 85g per 100g of protein. The main feature is the thermal processing it goes through called ‘enzymatic hydrolysis,’ which is the key to the super-fast absorption rate.

**WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HYDROLYSED WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE?**
-------------------------------------------------------------

This ‘enzymatic hydrolysis’ process breaks down the long protein chains in order to separate them into small chain peptides. These smaller chain peptides are easier for the body to absorb, giving you the fastest delivery of amino acids to help aid rapid recovery.

Below, we’ve outlined the differences between our four [whey protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) and how they differ from one another.

### **PURE WHEY PROTEIN™**

80% protein content with 1.5g of carbohydrates and 2g fat per 30g serving, along with an unrivalled amino acid profile. [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) combines high quality with phenomenal value for money.

### **PURE WHEY ISOLATE™ 90**

90% protein with 0.6g carbs and 0.3g fat per serving. Slightly faster absorption rate and perfect for those cutting carbs or on an energy restricted diet.

### **PURE WHEY ISOLATE™ 97**

This is an exceptionally high quality protein and with a huge 97% protein content. Minimal carbs and fat ensure you are only ingesting 99% of calories from high quality protein.

### **HYDROLYSED WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE**

Due to its hydrolysis, our Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate is the fastest absorbing of all our protein powders.

Why not try using our Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate in a DIY post workout shake along with Waxy Maize Starch, Glutamine Peptides, Leucine and Creatine.
