### 10 Ingredients You Need In The Kitchen

**Pure Whey Protein™.**

Our best-selling [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)**™** powder comes in 20 flavours (for now!) making it the perfect protein powder ingredient for healthier cookies, bars, cakes, and muffins.

**Organic Virgin Coconut Oil.**

Organic coconut oil is a great ingredient for greasing and lining baking tins, adding moisture to recipes, or even spreading on hot, fresh baked goods. Yum! Because coconut oil is a healthy [MCT](../../medium-chain-triglycerides.html) fat, it’s a popular choice of fat ingredient for health-focused bakers.

**VitaFiber™.**

If you haven’t tried [VitaFiber](../../vitafiber-powder.html)**™** yet, you need to get on it! It will transform your protein baking. With just two ingredients (Pure Whey Protein**™** and VitaFiber**™**) you can create tasty, low carb cookies like these [VitaFiber**™** Protein Cookies](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/vitafiber-protein-cookies-recipe/)

**Liquid Egg Whites.**

Keep at least one bottle of [liquid egg whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html) on hand (bonus: they don’t need to be kept in the fridge until they’ve been opened). You’ll have the option of adding loads of protein (and practically zero carbs or fats) to baking recipes, omelettes, frittatas and more. If a recipe calls for several whole eggs, replace one or more with liquid egg whites to suit your macros.

**Chia Seeds.**

Chia seeds swell up in water, making them a fantastic binding ingredient for healthy baking. You can also make them into Chia Pudding, add them to your morning oats, use as a granola ingredient, or pop some in your shake. [Chia seeds](../../chia-seeds.html) add healthy fats, fibre, and some extra protein.

**Peanut Butter.**

Why limit your baking repertoire to peanut butter when we have so many nut, seed, and flavoured [nut butters](../../foods/nut-butters.html) to choose from? Nut and seed butters add flavour and fats to your recipes, or you can spread them onto your homemade breads, cakes, and muffins. Some customers put nut butter on their sweet potatoes – we’re not judging!

**Liquiflav™.**

Our sugar-free sweeteners are a brilliant way to flavour your sweet recipes. Use [Liquiflav](../../liquiflav.html)**™** add plenty of sweetness without any calories or macros. And you don’t need much, so one little bottle goes a very long way. Use in recipes, in your oats, with plain Greek yoghurt or cottage cheese, or in your coffee.

**Stevia Extract.**

If you like your sweeteners to be all-natural, keep a bag of Stevia extract in your baking cupboard. [Stevia](../../stevia-extract-powder.html) is a non-sugar sweetener derived from the Stevia leaf. It is macro and calorie free, and delivers a lot of sweetness. Ideal for any recipe that calls for sugar, and great in coffee, tea, and porridge too.

**Quinoa Flour.**

Quinoa flour is a low-GI source of carbohydrate which has the added bonus of being gluten free, and suitable for vegans. You can use quinoa flour in place of other flours in any sweet or savoury recipe. It’s ideal for protein mug cakes. Here’s one of our favourite recipes on The Core**™**, the [Vegan Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter Stuffed Cookie](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/vegan-chocolate-chip-peanut-butter-stuffed-cookie-recipe/)!
