------------------------------------------------

BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale takes on Marco Antonio Periban this weekend at the Echo Arena in Liverpool, live on Sky Pay Per View. Periban, a former world title challenger from Mexico, is a dangerous opponent for James who is already the mandatory challenger for Carl Froch’s IBF World Title. James is attempting to make history by becoming the first British Olympic Gold Medal winning boxer to win a professional world title; beat Periban and James’ next fight is for a world title.

### Expect a performance

Talking exclusively to BULK POWDERS™ just before leaving for the press conference, James said, “I feel absolutely fantastic. This is the best training camp I’ve ever had – I even feel fitter and stronger than I did before the Gonzales fight (note: James knocked out the previously unbeaten Gonzales in the 4th round at Wembley Stadium in May, to set up a fight with Carl Froch). Expect a performance.”

BULK POWDERS™ had previously asked DeGale why he’d chosen to take a fight as dangerous as Periban. Typically, if fighters have a guaranteed shot at the world title they tend to take very easy warm up fights or sit on the side-lines and wait for their shot. We asked James if he still felt he’d made the right decision and he quickly replied, “100%. I’m fit, confident and ready to go. The only reason I can see why you’d want an easy fight is if you doubt your own ability against other world level fighters. I didn’t go through this entire training camp to fight an over matched opponent.”

### Hard training, precise nutrition and quality rest

James uses a wide range of BULK POWDERS™ products, including [Informed Whey™](../../informed-whey.html "Informed Whey"), [Complete Protein Porridge™](../../complete-protein-porridge.html "Complete Protein Porridge") and [Complete Hydration™](../../complete-hydration-drink.html "Complete Hydration") to complement his intense training. James’ trainer Jim McDonnell said, “hard training, precise nutrition and quality rest are three critical areas for all athletes to focus on.”

Everyone at BULK POWDERS™ wishes James all the best for this weekend’s fight!
