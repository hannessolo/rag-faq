### Summary

An old classic with a bit of a twist. Fruit crumble made with chocolate protein. Taste sensation!

### **Instructions**

1.) Preheat oven to 200 degrees  
2.) Mix dry ingredients together  
3.) Add wet (oil/yoghurt) to dry mix and stir with wooden spoon to start the process.  When it looks a bit drier get your hands in and rub the mixture together until it looks like a rough crumble mixture.
