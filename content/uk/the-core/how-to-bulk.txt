Bulking season isn’t just for bodybuilders anymore—it’s a term you’re likely to hear around the gym and beyond, and for good reason.

Taking time to focus on [building muscle mass](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/the-most-important-principles-for-building-muscle/) has many benefits. Stronger bones, bigger muscles, better performance in the gym, and more energy from all those extra calories. 

If you’ve been hesitant to bulk because you’re worried about looking like The Hulk, don’t stress. We’re here to break down what bulking really is so if you’re thinking of giving one a try, you can go in with confidence.

**What is bulking?**
--------------------

Bulking is all about packing on muscle by eating more and lifting heavier. It’s the phase where you up your calorie intake—eating more than your body burns—so you’ve got the extra fuel needed to grow those muscles. 

Pair that with consistent weight training, where you’re gradually pushing yourself to lift more or increase reps, and you’re on the road to serious gains.

A bulk can be done in 10-12 weeks, but ideally, you’ll want to stick with it for much longer to see the best results.

**How to bulk up fast**
-----------------------

Now that you know what bulking is, you’re probably wondering how to bulk up as quickly as possible. But the better question is, how do you bulk properly? The approach you take will have a big impact on your results.

The truth is, no matter how you go about it, bulking takes time, and the gains might seem slow at first.

### **Average Muscle Mass Gain When Bulking**

**Beginner:** 1-1.5% of bodyweight per month

**Intermediate:** 0.5-1% of bodyweight per month

**Advanced:** 0.25-0.5% of bodyweight per month

Yes, that’s per month. And if you’re a woman, you can expect about half those rates. It might sound like a slow process, but patience is key when bulking.

For many, the biggest challenge is not just the physical aspect, but the mental one, especially if you’re worried about gaining body fat. 

It’s easy to be tempted to jump into a cut when your clothes start feeling tighter, but remember, building muscle takes time. You should aim to bulk for at least three months, but ideally much longer.

A good strategy is to bulk for 10-20 weeks and then assess how you’re feeling in terms of fat gain. If you’re starting to feel a bit too fluffy, it might be time for a mini cut.

As long as you keep your [protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein) intake high and continue training hard, you can maintain most of your muscle while trimming down a bit.

It’s best to work with a coach to help navigate these phases and keep you on track when you’re doubting your progress.

### **Eat at a caloric surplus**

You can’t build muscle without enough fuel—simple as that. If you nail your nutrition, you’re already halfway there.

You might have heard of a “dirty bulk”, where the focus is on eating as many calories as possible without worrying too much about the quality of the food.

While this approach can work in some ways, it often leads to a fair amount of body fat gain. What you need is a balanced and [healthy diet for building muscle](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/diet-for-muscle-gain/).

A lean or moderate bulk is usually more sustainable. Sure, you can indulge in treats, but sticking to around 80% whole food source help you feel and perform better. Think like fresh fruit and veg, whole grains, and lean proteins. The other 20%? That’s where your takeaways and favourite snacks come in.

As for how much you should eat, that’s where things get personal. Asking your gym mate if 3,000 calories is enough won’t cut it.

They might need that amount, but their height, weight, body composition and training are probably different from yours. You need a plan that’s tailored to your body and goals.

### **Eat more carbs than you usually do**

Let’s set the record straight: carbs are your best buddy when it comes to bulking. When you combine carbs with protein, insulin levels spike higher than if you were just eating protein or carbs alone.

And here’s why that’s a game-changer: insulin helps shuttle amino acids into your muscle cells, making sure leucine kicks muscle protein synthesis (MPS) into high gear.

Insulin also reduces muscle protein breakdown, making carbs the optimal fuel for your workouts.

When you’re pushing for strength gains and smashing through a progressive overload programme, you need every bit of energy you can get. So, don’t skimp on the carbs—fuel up and get those gains. ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848650/#:~:text=3.5.1.%20Carbohydrate%20Coingestion))

### **Lift heavy**

If you want to increase muscle mass, then you have to lift heavy. With the support of your diet, and following a progressive overload plan (where you work to increase weight or volume of reps every few weeks) you’re well on your way to them gains. 

One particularly interesting study ([3](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00789.2006#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%20early%20molecular,occurs%20over%20the%20training%20period)) shows why lifting heavy is a must during your bulking phase. It found that lifting heavier weights kick-starts the muscle growth process more effectively than lighter loads.

Over time, sticking with those heavy lifts leads to bigger muscle gains. So, if you’re serious about packing on muscle, going heavy is the way to go—it’s the best way to get those growth signals firing.

### **Take bulking supplements** 

Some support from [creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine) and potentially also a [Mass Gainer](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-mass-gainer/bble-cmas) if you struggle to gain can really help you maximise your muscle mass.

[Mass Gainers](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/mass-gainers) are packed with calories, protein, and carbs, making it easier to hit your daily calorie goals and fuel your muscles for growth.

Creatine, on the other hand, boosts your strength and power in the gym, helping you lift heavier and train harder. ([4](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-4-6)) 

 Together, they’re a solid combo for anyone looking to bulk up—giving you the extra energy and nutrients you need to see serious results.

But remember, Mass Gainers are a supplement to complement your nutrition. They won’t do all the heavy lifting if your food isn’t on point. 

More recent studies also suggest that combining [beta-alanine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/beta-alanine/bpb-bala-0000) with [creatine monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate/bpb-cmon-0000) can be even more effective than using creatine alone ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2048496/#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20do%20suggest%2C%20however,fatigue%20%5B31%2C32%5D)). This combination appears to enhance strength, increase lean muscle mass, reduce body fat percentage, and delay muscle fatigue during workouts. What’s not to love?

**Protein and Bulking**
-----------------------

Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is the process where your body repairs and builds new muscle tissue after a workout. When you lift weights or do resistance training, you create tiny tears in your muscle fibres.

Your body then gets to work repairing these tears, which is how your muscles grow bigger and stronger. So don’t skip rest days either as your muscles need the time to heal and grow.

To fuel this process, your body needs protein, which is why getting enough protein—through food or supplements—is so important. 

### How much protein for bulking and when to eat it?

To maximise hypertrophy, the recommendation is that you should consume protein every 3-5 hours. Or, if you can’t be faffed with timings, simply divide your overall daily protein intake over 3-5 meals per day in whatever suits best for your lifestyle. 

For muscle gain, aim for a protein intake of 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of total body weight (TBW). Generally, the leaner you are, the more muscle mass you have, and the harder you train, the closer to the higher end of that range you should be. 

Most people looking to build muscle simply use their TBW to calculate protein needs. If you’re already in good shape and have some training under your belt, it’s a good idea to aim for the higher end of the scale.

### **Which protein is best for bulking?**

For bulking, protein is only effective if it contains [leucine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/leucine/bpb-lleu-0000). Studies show that leucine—one of the nine essential amino acids and part of the three branched-chain amino acids ([BCAAs](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids/bcaa))—is the key amino acid that triggers muscle protein synthesis.

Without leucine, MPS won’t activate, and your muscles won’t grow or repair as they should. This was demonstrated in a study where participants were given different protein sources, with those consuming leucine-rich proteins showing better muscle growth ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848650/)). 

To maximise your gains during a bulk, aim to include a protein source with around 4g of leucine per meal to ensure MPS is activated. This is why many athletes choose [whey protein supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein)—they’re high in leucine, and the amino acids are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream.

But don’t go overboard. Much like you can only fill a car with so much petrol, your body has an upper limit. Stick to the recommended dose of leucine to avoid wasting it.

### **What about plant protein for bulking?**

Plant-based proteins often don’t contain a full amino acid profile, which can make it tricky to get enough leucine. However, combining plant protein sources can give you a complete profile. 

Quality [plant-based protein powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-powder/vser-vppo) also typically have a full amino acid profile added, ensuring you get the desired MPS response. Just be sure to read labels and do a bit of research to ensure you’re getting what you need.

**How to lean bulk** 
---------------------

How to lean bulk—also known as how to bulk without turning into the Michelin Man. Let’s kick things off with a little truth bomb: whether you’re dirty bulking or lean bulking, muscle growth is going to be a slow grind.

The difference? A dirty bulk will have you gaining a higher rate of body fat alongside that muscle, while a lean bulk is all about being smart with your calories.

In a lean bulk, you increase your calories gradually, only bumping them up when you hit a plateau. And the type of food you eat is all about the 80/20 rule—focusing on healthy, whole foods for 80% of your intake, and leaving room for the occasional treat in the other 20%.

If you’re a genetic ‘hard gainer’ who struggles to pack on mass, you might need to tilt that balance a bit to get more calories in without feeling stuffed all the time. Or that’s where a Mass Gainer could be for you.

Just remember, even in a lean bulk, you will still gain _some_ body fat, as it’s impossible not to. You’ll just be able to control it a lot better.

**What to eat when bulking**
----------------------------

When it comes to bulking, you can pretty much eat whatever you fancy—just make sure you’re in a calorie surplus and gradually upping those numbers as needed. The star of the show, though, is protein. 

Hitting your protein goal is key, as it’s the magic ingredient for muscle growth and recovery. One study ([6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28698222/)) even backs it up, highlighting that protein is the most crucial macronutrient in a bulking diet, so make sure you’re getting enough.

If you want to keep the fat gain in check, lean protein sources like chicken or turkey are your best mate.

As for carbs, stick to whole grains, potatoes and veggies to boost both your fibre and carb intake. And don’t forget that at least 25% of your diet should come from fats—they’re vital for various health markers.

Now, if you’ve been bulking for a while and your calorie needs have skyrocketed, you might struggle to hit those numbers without a bit of help from some seriously tasty food. We’re not saying a full blown dirty bulk is the way to go, but there’s a lot to be said for a bit of balance. 

So, go ahead and indulge in your favourite treats, dine out without counting every calorie, and if you’re a fan of a thick smear of [peanut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut) on toast, go nuts (pun totally intended). Eating freely in terms of calories is the real perk of bulking—well, that and the gains, obviously.

**How to cut** 
---------------

Cutting isn’t just the opposite of bulking, it’s more about adjusting your approach while maintaining key elements from your bulking phase.

The essentials remain: prioritise your protein intake and keep your lifting intensity high. Here’s a quick overview of how to cut effectively:

### **Eat at a Caloric Deficit**

To shed fat, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. This means eating less, but don’t worry—protein and heavy lifting will help you retain muscle mass while you lean out.

### **Keep Lifting Heavy (As Much as Possible)**

Continue to lift heavy weights. Maintaining your strength and training intensity will help preserve the muscle you’ve worked hard to build.

### **Prioritise Protein Intake**

Keep your protein levels high, perhaps even higher than during your bulking phase. This helps protect your muscle mass while you’re in a caloric deficit.

Much like how you can’t avoid some fat gain in a bulk, you can’t avoid some muscle mass reduction in a cut, but you can significantly reduce it with the right protein intake. 

### **Be Patient and Consistent**

Just like bulking, cutting takes time. Stay consistent with your diet and workouts, and remember that results will come with patience.

### **Take Cutting Supplements**

No, we’re not talking about fat loss pills. Use supplements like creatine to maintain your performance in the gym, even with fewer calories. It helps you keep your strength and endurance up despite the reduced fuel.

### **In Summary: How to bulk**

While cutting might mean eating less and tweaking your approach, the core principles of high protein and heavy lifting stay the same.
