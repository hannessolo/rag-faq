These tasty protein truffles are high in protein and only require four ingredients. They make a great snack any time of day and also look good as a decorative topping on any high protein bake (as you can see!).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.) Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. The results should be a fairly sticky dough-like consistency.

2.) If it looks too dry, add a touch more Almond Milk. If it looks too wet, add more GF Ultra Fine Oats.

3.) With wet hands, break off a bit of the dough & roll into a ball. Place onto a greased sheet.

4.) Continue rolling until all of the dough is used.

5.) Refrigerate for 2 hours.

6.) Decorate with toppings of choice.
