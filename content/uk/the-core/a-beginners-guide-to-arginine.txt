**What is Arginine?**
---------------------

If you’re taking your first steps in sports nutrition, this name may ring a bell but, there’s a lot to find out. We’ve put together this beginner’s guide to Arginine to take you through everything you need to know so, let’s get started.

Arginine AKA L-Arginine is a conditional amino acid meaning it’s produced by our body. When taken as a supplement, it can help with things like migraine and inflammation. But what does Arginine actually do to your body? It boosts Nitric Oxide levels which stimulate the blood vessels’ inner walls and dilates them to allow more blood to flow freely. In other words, it relaxes blood vessels and can be pretty good for your heart and wider cardiovascular system.

When to Take Arginine

To get the most out of Arginine, it’s best to consume it roughly 30 minutes before your session. That way you’ll have absorbed it by the time you start working out. Even though there’s no set dosage, it’s widely recommended to roughly take 3g of L-Arginine with at least 50ml of water.
