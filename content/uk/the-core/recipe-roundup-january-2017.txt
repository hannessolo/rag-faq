Want to try something new this weekend? Why not try one (or two!) of our featured recipes from January. There’s something for everyone in our recipe roundup…

January was the month of Veganuary, where people all over the world join a campaign to try out Veganism for 31 days. Recipes this month are a few of quick and easy Vegan options including a delicious Cannellini Bean Blondie.

Product of the Month
--------------------

The must-have essential for your kitchen cupboard this month is **[Coconut Oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html)**.

Organic Virgin Coconut Oil is extremely versatile but is primarily used for cooking, frying and baking; often in place of olive oil, sunflower oil, butter or margarine. Organic Virgin Coconut Oil can also be used to innovate new, exciting recipes.

Nutritionally speaking, Organic Virgin Coconut Oil impresses in many regards. It is cholesterol-free and contains zero trans-fatty acids, yet it is packed with medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), particularly lauric acid. Organic Virgin Coconut Oil actually contains more lauric acid than any other food source – in fact, lauric acid comprises in excess of 50% of the fat content within Organic Virgin Coconut Oil.

For the sweet tooth…
