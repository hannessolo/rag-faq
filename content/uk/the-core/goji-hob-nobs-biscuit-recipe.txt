You can’t beat a cup of tea and a couple of biscuits as an afternoon pick me up. Now you can treat yourself guilt-free. With only 78 calories per Goji Biscuit, here is [The Muscle Bakery](https://themusclebakery.com/)‘s take on the classic Hob Nob – perfect for dunking!

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.) Pre-heat oven to 180 Degrees C.

2.) Mix dry ingredients into a bowl then fold in wet ingredients until everything is well combined.

3.) Place bowl in fridge for ½ an hour.

4.) Remove from fridge and begin by making ball shapes (as big or small as you prefer) and then press onto a lined baking tray.

Tip: if you are not very skilled in round-shape making, use a metal muffin tray and press mix into that to ensure even, round shapes every time.

5.) Repeat until all mix is done and proceed to bake for approx. 10-15mins until they are golden.

Enjoy on their own, in yoghurt, with your tea or with melted chocolate spread over the top (the latter was our fave combo).

You can make them as big, small, thick, thin as you prefer too!
