Christmas is upon us and while it is the season to be jolly, we don’t want to lose sight of our fitness goals. But this doesn’t mean we have to become total party-poopers and live like particularly boring hermits during the month of December. These tips will help you stay on track to smashing your goals, while ensuring you don’t miss out on all the festive fun.

Bottling It
-----------

Making some changes to your usual Christmas alcoholic beverages can really make a big difference. Just swapping pints for bottles can save on those empty calories. On average, 10 pints of beer equates to 400 extra calories when compared to 10 bottles of beer. Of course, the best option is to give beer a swerve and to go for something less-calorific.

Making Smart Swaps
------------------

Switching to spirits with low-sugar mixers helps massively save on the calories. Classic mixers like gin & slimline tonic and rum & diet cola are light on the carbs and the cals. If you’re feeling particularly fancy, go for a whisky sour which can be made with our [Liquid Egg Whites](https://www.bulk.com/uk/liquid-egg-whites.html) and is packed full of protein.

Keep Stepping On
----------------

It’s important over the Christmas period and the unwanted pounds we may gain, to keep moving and getting those daily steps in. Why not walk down the shops instead of taking the car and take in some nice winter walks with loved ones to burn through those Christmas Pud calories?

Make The Most Of Those Empty Gyms
---------------------------------

It goes without saying that gyms are going to be less busy over Christmas. So, why not take advantage of this? No waiting for the chest press, no one loudly dropping weights, no one taking selfies in the mirrors… heaven.

Keep Sweets Out Of Sight
------------------------

It was Oscar Wilde who said ‘I can resist anything except temptation’. And he was right. To avoid temptation, keep your biscuits, chocolate and other lovely treats locked away in the cupboard until Christmas Day. If you fancy something sweet and delicious, try our [MACRO MUNCH™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/macro-munch-protein-bar.html) Bars.

Local Festive Fitness Get Togethers
-----------------------------------

Getting involved in local group fitness events, like Santa Runs, is a great way to keep fit and meet new people during December and beyond. Who doesn’t love the sight of a hundred Santas running around a park?

Boost Your Immune System
------------------------

With the days getting shorter, meaning there’s less sunlight, our Vitamin D levels take a hit. This essential vitamin is crucial for our immune system and at this time of year, when it takes more of a battering than usual, it’s important that we take [Vitamin D](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitamin-d3-tablets/bpb-vd3t-0000) supplements to keep our levels topped up.

Leave The Leftovers
-------------------

Don’t be tempted to fry up your leftovers from the night before for breakfast. Those naughty calories will just add up… Instead, go for something as equally delicious and decidedly healthier for brekkie, like our [Baked Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/blueberry-baked-oats/) recipe which features our [Pure Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html) and [Oat Drink](https://www.bulk.com/uk/oat-drink.html). Packed full of good nutrients, it’ll also keep you fuller for longer so that you’ll be less likely to reach for those mid-morning chocolate biscuits.

Hydration For The Duration
--------------------------

It’s imperative that you stay hydrated during the Christmas Party Season. Even look to double the amount of water you normally consume on a daily basis. It’ll help with hangovers and digestion after all those boozy nights and big meals. Make sure you’re never dehydrated with our [Half Gallon Water Bottle](https://www.bulk.com/uk/half-gallon-water-bottle.html).

Sleep On It
-----------

At the end of day (literally), sleep is key for us staying on track to smashing our fitness goals. It’s even more important during the festive period because we’re going to have some late nights which will make us feel run down and below par. Keep your energy high up by ensuring you get in some regular good nights’ sleep and that you find time to chill out when it all gets Xmas manic.

Summary
-------

So there we have it. Opt for lower calorie options, keep your steps up, take advantage of the quiet gyms and local fitness clubs, take your Vitamin D, don’t touch the leftovers, stay hydrated and get plenty of sleep.
