If you missed our [first post](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/losing-baby-weight-pregnancy-bulk-powders/ "Introducing the BULK POWDERS™ 30 Day Weight Loss Challenge") published a couple of weeks ago, Lorraine, author of OnlineMummy.co.uk, has jumped on board the [BULK POWDERS™ 30 Day Weight Loss Challenge](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/losing-baby-weight-pregnancy-bulk-powders/ "Post pregnancy baby weight loss challenge") to help lose baby weight post pregnancy. By using our [Pure Whey Isolate™ 90 protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-isolate-90.html "Pure Whey Isolate™ 90 protein") and [CLA Softgels](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cla-conjugated-linoleic-acid-softgels.html "CLA Softgels 1000mg") alongside a healthy balanced diet and training routine, Lorraine is shedding baby weight and we’re following her progress every step of the way.
