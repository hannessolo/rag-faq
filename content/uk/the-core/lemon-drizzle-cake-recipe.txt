A classic recipe with a seductive protein twist.  Grab your pinnies, whisks at the ready, and get mixing! This is a simple and nutritious Lemon Drizzle Cake recipe parading over 13g of protein per serving. Powerful and tasty!

### Instructions:

1.) Preheat oven to 180 Degrees.

2.) Mix all your cake ingredients in a bowl, no particular order, just make sure to leave the vinegar for last, then transfer mix to a silicone loaf pan and bake for approximately 20 minutes until slightly golden over the top. Remove from oven, but leave oven on.

3.) In the meantime, you will need to make the drizzle. Put agave and lemon juice in a pan and bring to the boil, at which point you need to add the [VitaFiber](../../vitafiber-powder.html "VitaFiber")™ and with a whisk, blend immediately until vitafiber is dissolved completely. Then, bring to the boil again, it will happen fairly quickly so don’t get distracted! As soon as it boils up a little remove from heat and drizzle over the cake.

4.) Place back in oven and bake for a further 10-15 minutes, until baked through. You may need to poke it to see if it has cooked through in the middle.

5.) Leave to cool or cut it up immediately and burn your mouth while ooing and aahing. Up to you. We did the latter!
