### Summary

When we were younger, who didn’t want to be the Milkybar Kid? Well guess what, this just happened! A childhood dream-maker in the form of a protein white chocolate recipe! The Milkybar Kid is strong and tough, and only the best is good enough…

### Instructions

1.) In a glass bowl add the raw cacao butter and xylitol, melt it in a microwave or bain marie. Storing every 30-45 seconds or so. I chose microwave simply because it was quicker.

2.) Whip out 2 silicon loaf pans, as you will use this to pour your chocolate in later, unless you have an actual chocolate mould, in that case, you can also use that.

3.) Once all your butter has melted, you can go adding in the [whey protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html) and keep mixing. It will remain a liquid but this is fine, the butter will solidify later.

4.) Then, pour into your mould’s and pop into fridge or freezer, depends how eager you are to eat the chocolate!

5.) You will know it’s done when the whole bar has hardened.

Makes 2 Large bars.
