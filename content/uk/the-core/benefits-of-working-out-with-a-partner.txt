To lead a healthy life, two things you should definitely do are engage in regular exercise and hang out with friends. The best idea is to combine both things and work out with your buddies to have fun, get motivated and fast-track your goals.

Some people exercise alone to stay focused, but for others, having an exercise partner boosts their motivation and overall performance. A sense of healthy competition can prevail between you and your gym buddy, which will keep your fitness level high. We have listed some of the benefits of working out with a partner below. Read on to learn more:

Workouts Will Be Fun:
---------------------

The gym can be a boring place, and while a bench press and treadmill may not be ideal ways to have a good time, having a friend as your workout partner will make exercising much more enjoyable. You can perform some serious workouts with your friends — without being too serious. Having fun while performing serious activities is no harm. In fact, it will make the atmosphere lighter so that you can perform more vigilantly.

Healthy Competition:
--------------------

Working out with your friend can be a healthy form of competition, not to mention a great way for the two of you to keep fit. You obviously wouldn’t like to fall behind while performing with your friend. Exercising together will push you to work harder and be more consistent. Make sure to select an exercise partner who is at the same fitness level as you. You can compete against each other on smaller exercises, which will lead to better performance and stamina.

No More Quits:
--------------

After a tired or hectic day, you may not want to hit the gym. Sometimes you are simply feeling too lazy to go for a workout. However, having a gym partner can help you work out more consistently. Your partner should be motivated enough to never let you quit or miss the gym. You cannot reap the full benefits of exercise if you are not doing it regularly. Better stamina and enhanced performance can be achieved only if you are regular with your workout routine.

Afford the Services of a Personal Trainer:
------------------------------------------

You may not be able to afford a personal trainer for yourself, but with a friend, the two of you can share the expenses and hire a personal trainer together to reach your desired fitness level. A trainer will offer their expertise and help with your fitness in a great way. Quite often, we have poor form when we exercise, which can lead to injury. A personal trainer, however, will keep that in check. Moreover, a personal trainer can give you valuable insights into diets that will enable you to reach an optimum fitness level.

Less Risk of Injury:
--------------------

Your friends can help you during your workout. They can monitor the position of your back in a plank and tell you if you are leaning too far forward while in a squat. This can reduce the likelihood of injury. Mirrors are in the gym for this reason, but you cannot completely rely on them.

Reach Your Desired Fitness Level Faster:
----------------------------------------

Having a gym buddy will motivate you to work hard. You and your partner can perform different exercises together, which will allow you to reach your desired fitness level faster. Your friend can be your spotter and advisor, and your workout routine will be better. You can also set certain fitness goals and achieve them together for the best results.

You Can Try New Workouts:
-------------------------

Surrounding yourself by friends will make you less intimidated about starting a new activity that you may hesitate to do alone. It is a lot easier to start using the gym, hitting the free weights or taking a new class with a friend by your side. The same goes for starting a new diet plan, or simply trying out new exercise equipment. Get a friend on board if you have been fancying doing strength training, or attending a yoga or CrossFit class.

Always Room for Improvement:
----------------------------

With your friends working out in the gym with you, there is always a room for improvement — even if you have already reached your desired fitness level. They can be a great influence in teaching you some new workout regimes, or they can point out flaws in your exercises.

Motivation:
-----------

If you worry you are not doing it right, or if things are getting difficult for you and you are thinking of quitting the gym, your workout friend can be a great source of motivation. They can boost your confidence and encourage you to keep going. You can do the same for your friends when they feel less motivated.

Two-Person Exercise:
--------------------

A gym buddy will help you broaden the scope of what you can do in the gym. You will be able to perform numerous partner exercises that you can’t do solo. The chipper-hurricane, for example, is an exercise in which you perform different workout routines as fast as possible, and whenever your partner slows down, you tag them out and take over. Other than the chipper-hurricane, the medicine ball pass and partner push-ups are additional examples of partner workouts that you can try.

According to a research study, you will be more likely to stay fit and eat well if you are surrounded by people who are also into fitness. Your friends are an asset in your life, and having them as your gym buddies will never make exercising dull. These are some of the simple advantages that you can gain by having your friend as your gym buddy. However, you can only reap these benefits if your gym buddy is committed, has similar goals and shares the same attitude. Find your gym buddy and start working out together if you aren’t already.
