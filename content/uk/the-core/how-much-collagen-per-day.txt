[Collagen](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/collagen) has had a glow-up. Everyone is suddenly talking about its protein content, its effect on our skin and the impact on our bones. It’s _the_ on-trend ingredient. 

But how much do you actually know about it? Probably not as much as you’d like. 

Let’s take a deep dive into the ingredient that’s taking over the health and fitness industry. 

**What is collagen?**
---------------------

Collagen is a protein that accounts for around 30% of your body’s total protein. It forms the building foundations for your skin, muscles, bones, testaments and ligaments. Basically, it’s a hugely important part of your body.

But, the body doesn’t always produce the same amount – after the age of 20, our bodies typically produce 1% less collagen each year. It’s the reason we notice more wrinkles, sagging skin and stiff joints as we age. 

It’s also the reason you might want to top with [collagen supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/collagen). 

**How much collagen per day?**
------------------------------

There aren’t any official guidelines on the recommended collagen intake, but studies suggest between 2.5g and 15g is a safe and effective amount. 

**How much collagen per day is recommended for women?**
-------------------------------------------------------

The recommended amount stays the same for women and men. Aim to consume somewhere between 2.5g-15g collagen per day to notice the benefits. 

Many studies support this. For example, women taking 10g of collagen over the course of 56 days noticed [significant improvement in their skin hydration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6835901/), elasticity, roughness, and density.

**How much bovine collagen per day?**
-------------------------------------

Firstly, let’s get into the difference between collagen and bovine collagen. Bovine collagen is a type 1 and 3 collagen that stems from cows, which is why it’s also known as beef collagen. 

Whilst regular collagen and marine collagen are more likely to quickly improve the health of your skin, hair and nails, bovine collagen can support your gut and joint health. 

In regards to your daily amount, bovine collagen is similar to regular collagen. Aim for between 2.5 and 15 grams of hydrolysed collagen peptides each day to stay within the suggested amount.

**How much marine collagen per day?**
-------------------------------------

As you may have guessed, [marine collagen](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/marine-collagen-vitamin-c/bpb-mcol) is a type 1 collagen sourced from fish. It’s typically more bioavailable than bovine collagen (that means you can digest it easier) and it’s suitable for a pescatarian diet. 

Since it’s a type 1 collagen, it’s often used to improve skin elasticity, enhance hair growth, and promote bone strength.

Once again, to see the best chance of results, take between 2.5 and 15 grams of hydrolysed collagen peptides each day.

**How do you get more collagen in your diet?**
----------------------------------------------

It’s best to get collagen from food. As previously mentioned, beef and fish contain high amounts of collagen, alongside chicken and egg whites.

These foods are also high in protein, perfect if you’re combining your increased collagen with a training programme. 

Of course, those foods won’t work if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. If you do eat plant-based, add citrus fruits, tropical fruits, cashew nuts, beans, tomatoes, and garlic to your meals to increase your collagen intake. 

For when you can’t get enough from food, use [collagen supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/collagen). Our [Collagen and Vitamin C Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/collagen-vitamin-c/bpb-coll-vitc) packs 12g collagen into every serving – a simple and delicious way to get your required amount.

It also provides at least 82% protein content in every serving – ideal if you’re looking for an easy way to hit your protein goals. 

[Collagen Coffee](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/collagen-coffee/bpf-pcof) is another convenient way to include collagen as part of your daily routine. Replace your morning cup with Collagen Coffee for a better taste, more collagen and extra protein. Simple.

**The final word: How much collagen should you take per day?**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Whether it’s marine, bovine, or regular collagen, there are many benefits of collagen. 

To enjoy those benefits, you need to take between 2.5 and 15 grams of hydrolysed collagen peptides per day.

Use a combination of collagen-rich foods and supplements to get your daily dose.
