[Creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine) and [protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein) are the two most popular supplements among athletes, powerlifters and bodybuilders. And for good reason. Both offer tremendous benefits such as increased power output and aiding in muscle growth – something everybody wants. So which is better? Let’s find out.

Here we’ve laid out the basics of what these supplements are, what they can do for you and which one is better for your goals.

**What is the difference between creatine and protein?**
--------------------------------------------------------

Protein and creatine are very different. However, their effects on the body both help to enhance your strength and muscle hypertrophy potential.

By supplementing with creatine, you maximise your high-intensity energy output. In simple terms: more creatine stores = more rapid energy. 

The stronger you are, the more weight you can lift and therefore the more muscle you can potentially grow. In order for that muscle to grow, protein must be available to build up the new muscle tissue.

**What is creatine?**
---------------------

Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid made out of three amino acids: L-arginine, glycine and L-methionine. But simply put, creatine is a source of energy for rapid movement, as it can provide immediate energy for the muscles. We’ll explain more about this later.

Creatine can be obtained through our diet via meat and dairy products only, meaning those following a vegan or vegetarian diet should strongly consider supplementing with it. Although we do obtain some creatine from food, we never really fill up those creatine fuel tanks through diet alone. You might be wondering [how to take creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/beginners-guide-to-creatine/). 

The ideal maintenance dose of creatine is 5g per day (that’s a lot of steaks!) and this can only realistically be met when creatine supplements are taken in addition to your nutrition plan. For this reason, creatine monohydrate supplementation is a sure-fire way of saturating your creatine stores.

**What does creatine do?**
--------------------------

The phosphocreatine ATP pathway is used for high-intensity exercise, such as short bursts of powerful movements, like sprinting or lifting heavy weight. Creatine supplementation increases the stores of cellular phosphocreatine, making more energy available for this process.

Creatine is used up quickly and only provides energy for about 10 seconds, so keeping those creatine tanks filled to the brim ensures you perform to your maximum during lifting sessions.

In a normal diet that contains 1–2 g creatine per day, muscle creatine stores are about 60–80% saturated. Therefore, supplementation of creatine serves to increase muscle creatine by 20–40% \[[1](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z)\].

There are many [creatine benefits](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/benefits-of-taking-creatine/). Besides the reasons mentioned above, creatine also draws water molecules to the muscles where the majority of it is stored. This keeps your muscles hydrated which, when coupled with good nutrition and a solid training plan, can aid in muscle protein synthesis and reduce muscle breakdown when in a calorie deficit (i.e. dieting).

It can also aid in your muscle strength gaining potential by enabling your body to grind out those few extra reps, which do make a difference when you consider the long term effects these extra reps can have on your progress. In other words, creatine supplementation has the potential to help you be an absolute beast.

**What is protein?**
--------------------

Protein is an essential macronutrient that plays a crucial role in building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function and maintaining a healthy metabolism. It’s one of the three macronutrients, along with fats and carbohydrates.

Protein is made up of hundreds of amino acids (the building blocks of protein) stuck together. When protein is broken down and digested, these amino acids are used to repair and build new and often stronger muscle tissue (protein does a lot more than this, but we’ll keep it simple).

As protein is a macronutrient, it does contain calories and contributes to your daily caloric intake. We must consume protein through our diets in some form to survive – it’s essential. This is why [**whey protein**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) is classed as a food supplement.

Whole foods are always better than supplements, it’s just a lot more convenient to have after a training session than a chicken breast from your gym bag.

**Is it better to take creatine or protein?**
---------------------------------------------

This is a difficult one to answer because it depends on your goals. If your goals are more strength orientated, then creatine will help give you that extra explosive power to lift heavier.

However, for longer term results, protein is extremely helpful for rebuilding your muscles after a workout, which in turn will help you to increase your strength gradually over time.

But to be honest, this question is invalid, as you don’t have to choose between them. You can take both.

If you had to choose, though, many would recommend creatine. Most people can meet their protein requirements each day through food alone (it can be tricky, but can be done). However, nobody can easily consume 5g of creatine per day through their diet.

**Frequently asked questions**
------------------------------

### **Can you mix creatine with protein powder?**

Yes, creatine mixes easily with any protein powder.

Unflavoured is your best bet, and will be tasteless when mixed with flavoured protein powder.

### **How much protein do I need?**

Our age, gender and level of physical activity all play a part in our individual protein needs, as well as protein absorption.

However, the [British Nutrition Association](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/healthy-sustainable-diets/protein/?level=Health%20professional) states that the average intake of protein in the UK for adults is 0.75g protein per kilogram of body weight per day.

To give two examples, this equates to 64g protein per day for a person weighing 85kg or 49g protein per day for a person weighing 65kg.

### **Is creatine the same as protein?**

Creatine is made out of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. So yes, creatine is technically a protein. However, in terms of supplementation, creatine monohydrate serves a very different purpose to protein powder.
