DeGale vs. Periban November 22nd 2014
-------------------------------------

BULK POWDERS™ athlete [James DeGale](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/bulkpowders-james-degale-formalise-partnership/ "James DeGale") continues his march towards a world title, with a fight against former world title challenger Marco Antonio Periban on 22nd November 2014 at the Echo Arena, Liverpool. Periban, from Mexico, has previously fought for the WBC title, losing a close points decision to the vastly experienced Sakio Bika (one judge had the fight a draw).

### “I don’t need easy fights”

DeGale is coming off the back of a hugely impressive [stoppage win against the previously unbeaten Brandon Gonzales](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPZhbEqOy24 "DeGale vs. Gonzales"), and he’s focused on keeping the momentum going. With DeGale the mandatory for IBF champion Carl Froch, it wouldn’t have been surprising to see him take an easy ‘stay busy’ fight against an opponent with little desire. Instead, he’s taking on a fighter who has ambitions of his own to become a World Champion. DeGale commented, “look, I’ll fight anyone. I don’t need easy fights. Yes, the Carl Froch fight is the one that I want and I’m in a position where Carl has to fight me or give up his title. However, I’m not going to wait around for him. I’ve my own career to focus on.”

### “I can’t wait to put on a good show”

DeGale has previously enjoyed success at the Echo Arena. When asked about fighting again in Liverpool he said, “I’m excited to be going back  – I’ve good memories there, having won both the British and European titles in Liverpool. I got a great reception from the crowd at the Echo Arena last time out and I can’t wait to put on a good show.”

As always, BULK POWDERS™ will be with James every step of the way.
