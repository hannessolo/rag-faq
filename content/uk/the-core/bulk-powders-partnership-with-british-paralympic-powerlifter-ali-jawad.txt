BULK POWDERS™ are delighted to announce a partnership with Ali Jawad. Ali is a **British Paralympic Powerlifter**, fully focused on competing for medals at the 2016 Paralympics in Rio. As part of his preparation, BULK POWDERS™ will be Ali’s exclusive Performance Nutrition Partner, supplying him with a range of industry leading Informed Sport tested products, including TRI-PRO™ and [AFTERMATH](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/aftermath/bpps-amat)™.

Ali, who was born without legs, has a Bench Press personal best of 194kg and is aiming to break the 200kg barrier in Rio as he strives for Gold. Ali also suffers from Crohns Disease, which means he has to be particularly careful with his nutrition. Given the obstacles in Ali’s way, his achievements are nothing short of inspirational.

BULK POWDERS™ Product Director, Simon Jurkiw, commented, _“we’re really pleased to be working with an athlete of the calibre of Ali. Rio will be the pinnacle of the 2016 sporting calendar, and we’ll be doing all we can to help Ali perform at his best.” Ali said, “my entire focus is on Rio and appropriate performance nutrition will play a part in my performance. It was essential I have access to performance nutrition products that are both the highest quality and Informed Sport tested and BULK POWDERS™ can deliver exactly that._
