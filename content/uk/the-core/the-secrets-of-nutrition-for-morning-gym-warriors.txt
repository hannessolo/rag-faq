_Morning workout warriors know just how much can be achieved by training early in the am. Whether you love morning training, or do it through necessity, it’s crucial to get your nutrition right. Here’s how._

Do you live for your morning workouts? Or are you someone who hits the gym (or cardio) early because it’s the only time you get?

Either way, you’re doing a great thing. Morning training has positive effects way beyond your physique. Getting up early and finishing your workout before the rest of the world is awake gives you a huge sense of achievement. A morning workout sets you up for the day, helping you focus at work and be more productive. And training in the morning could even help you make better food choices.

So you’ve tackled your workout – and won. And it’s not even breakfast time yet. Ah… breakfast. It’s really important that morning gym warriors do breakfast properly. Misjudge it and you risk feeling tired, feeling bloated, battling hunger all day, and never making gains. Ready to get it right?

### **The trouble with fuelling morning workouts.**

Appetite, energy levels and digestion all play a role in how we choose, digest and respond to food in the morning. It’s called “break-fast” for a reason. After an overnight fast, our bodies want fuel. And if you’re training first thing, your choice of fuel is critical.

**Pre workout.  
**

**Liquid breakfast**: To fuel your morning workout, you need energy, focus and nutrients so you can train hard straight out of the blocks. Choose a combination of smart carbs, protein, fluid and a little caffeine for a pick-me-up. We love [ELEVATE](../../elevate.html)™ (10g carbs, a 250mg dose of caffeine and fatigue-fighting nutrients such as beta alanine and citrulline malate). 

**A proper meal**: If you prefer a more substantial meal and have time to cook, try a small stack of [Complete High Protein Pancakes](../../complete-high-protein-pancakes.html)™ topped with sliced banana and some natural peanut butter. Tasty protein, carbs and fats, in a convenient format designed for athletes, and those short on time.

**Intra workout.  
**

If you train in a fasted state, you must think about intra workout nutrition (what you drink during training). Glycogen stores are likely to be depleted overnight, so you need fuel and protein to power your training and help recovery. Without a supply of energy, the body can turn to muscle tissue as a fuel source. No bueno! So sip on BCAAs (branch chain amino acids) during training. [Instant BCAA](../../instantised-bcaa.html) is a great intra workout choice, mixes up immediately, tastes refreshing, and helps you get fluid in alongside those important amino acids.

**Post workout.  
**

**Liquid recovery**: With so little food in your system, it’s important to refuel quickly after morning training. You’ll need to combine protein, carbs and fats (depending on your training goals). That’s exactly what [AFTERMATH](../../aftermath.html)™ was designed for. It’s a premium protein blend with quality carbs and vital amino acids. Of course, our [Complete Breakfast Smoothie](../../complete-breakfast-protein-smoothie.html)™ is here to help (the clue is in the name) and it’s a very convenient way to get breakfast in if you rush from the gym to your desk. Need fewer carbs in your post workout recovery meal? Easy: standard [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™ is ideal (and convenient). If you need to add extra fat macros, you could throw in a scoop of chia seeds or a serving of Omega Oil.

**A proper meal**: Or how about those High Protein Pancakes? If you didn’t have them before training, try them after. They’re ideal (and so tasty!) And our [Complete Protein Porridge](../../complete-protein-porridge.html)™ takes the classic carb and protein meal to another level. It’s not just a convenient way of cooking proats without the fuss, it really does taste incredible. Accessorise with chia seeds, dried cranberries, dried coconut or a spoon of natural nut butters, to create your ideal macronutrient and flavour profile.
