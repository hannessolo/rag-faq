We know a lot of you find sports supplements confusing.  And we’ve tried to simplify it.  Using all the queries sent to our customer service team over the last 12 months, we have devised an infographic covering 90% of the questions we are regularly asked.

This guide includes an overview of some of our more popular supplements and how they align with your training goals, such as which supplement to use, when to take it and a recommended dose.  We understand everyone is different and certain supplements will work better for some than others, but this is a very basic snapshot of the various supplements available and how they could potentially help you on the road to personal glory.

So whether you’re looking to build muscle (whey protein isolate), pack on some size (creatine), aid your workout recovery (zma) or encourage healthy fat loss ([green tea extract](https://www.bulk.com/uk/super-strength-green-tea-capsules-400mg.html "Green Tea Extract")) hopefully this guide will point you in the right direction. Do your research, stock up, hit the gym and prepare to be awesome.
