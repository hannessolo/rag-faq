After sitting in the dark from the mainstream market for years, **[mushroom supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/mushroom-complex-capsules/bble-mush)** have experienced a strong growth in recent popularity, leading us to create our brand new [**Mushroom Complex Capsules**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/mushroom-complex-capsules/bble-mush).

But what’s so special about mushrooms, and why have we taken the time to create a capsule?

We’re here to explain everything there is to know about the benefits of mushroom supplements.

**What are mushroom supplements?**
----------------------------------

If someone was to casually tell you they were taking supplemental mushrooms, they’d likely be enjoying a supplemental cup of coffee replacement, taking a well-dosed capsule packed with mushroom extracts, or for the purists, tolerating a mushroom flavoured shake.

As mentioned earlier, mushrooms and mushroom supplements have experienced a strong growth in recent popularity.

There has been somewhat of a rediscovery of traditional use of species like Reishi, Cordyceps, Lion’s Mane and Chaga, as well as a lot of marketing from a number of American brands, who aren’t constrained by the UK and EU’s system of health claims.

So, why capsules?

We’re not really sure who first saw a Chaga mushroom and thought, “I’m going to eat that” (Google it, you’ll see they don’t exactly look appetising). As a result, we felt that a capsule was probably the most friendly format for our customers to get acquainted with this category of supplement.

For our capsules, we’ve taken powerful extracts of seven popular mushrooms.

Each capsule packs in extracts of Cordyceps sinensis, lion’s mane, reishi, chaga, shiitake, maitake and oyster.

You’ll find 500mg mushroom extract in total, divided into 71.5mg of each.

Each extract is standardised to provide 30% polysaccharides and is 15:1 in strength, so the actual mushroom equivalent is 7.5g per capsule.

**What are mushroom supplements good for?**
-------------------------------------------

There are a huge amount of human studies on mushrooms and mushroom extracts for various health outcomes, but no approved health claims, which doesn’t leave mush-room for manoeuvre here.

From looking at the orders of our customers who have bought this product so far, we can confirm they are also interested in adaptogens, [**nootropics**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-nootropic/bble-noot), [**immune support**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/immune-support), ayurveda and general health and wellbeing.

We’ve also added 10 micrograms of vegan-friendly vitamin D3, which contributes to normal immune function\* and muscle function\*\*

**Are mushroom supplements safe?**
----------------------------------

Contrary to the last paragraph, this one is incredibly easy to write. Yes. 

Mushroom extracts are very well-researched in humans.

If you were to go onto **[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Cordyceps+sinensis)**, which is a database of published, peer-reviewed research studies and search “Cordyceps sinensis”, with the filter of “humans” applied, you would get a return of 469 results. “Chaga” returns 102 results and “Reishi” returns 457. 

If you’re interested in taking mushroom extracts for a particular health outcome, beyond the realms of what we’re allowed to say, we would recommend doing some further research.

If you don’t feel up to trawling through the research studies on Pubmed, examine.com provides a nice, unbiased summary of the research on five of the main mushrooms in this supplement.

**How to take mushroom capsules**
---------------------------------

Everyone’s requirements will differ when it comes to mushrooms. As a general guide, we would recommend taking 1-3 of our powerful capsules per day.

**Summary**
