The organic market in the UK is worth over £2 billion a year, which shows that there are a number of people prepared to choose organic products over non-organic alternatives.

Despite the amount of money being spent, the organic market still only represents 1.5% of overall UK food and drink sales, showing that there is still a long way to go before organic produce can compete with non-organic sales.

The question is should you be starting to increase the organic products in your diet?

What Does ‘Organic’ Mean?
-------------------------

To label a food as organic farmers have to adhere to strict guidelines. The aim of organic production is to produce food in the most natural way possible. This means ensuring high levels of animal welfare and avoiding the use of chemicals such as pesticides, man made herbicides or artificial fertilisers. The highest levels of animal welfare must be maintained and livestock are not subjected to growth hormones or harsh conditions.

There is also a real focus on ensuring that food is produced in a sustainable way.

All organic certified farmers and food producers are inspected at least once a year to ensure that their meeting the organic certified standards enforced by European law.

The Benefits of Organic Foods
-----------------------------

It’s suggested that food grown organically contains more nutrients and fewer nitrates.

The British Journal of Nutrition reported on a research project into organic food, which discovered that there was a significant difference in nutritional value compared to foods grown using non-organic methods.

The study was conducted in 2014 by scientists at Newcastle University and results showed that organic crops contained up to 60% more antioxidants than non-organic grown foods.

In addition, the study revealed that organic milk and meat contain around 50% more omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for normal bodily function.

Professor Carlo Leifert of Newcastle University concluded that the study had proven that ‘organic food is high in antioxidants and lower in toxic metals and pesticides’.

The study mentioned above suggests there is a nutritional difference between organic and non-organic food. By choosing organic foods more regularly in your diet you will be able to reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals from non-organic food, which is produced through farming methods heavily reliant on the use of pesticides.

Why Are Organic Products More Expensive?
----------------------------------------

Organic products are more expensive, but why is this? Organic farming is more time intensive and the strict regulations mean that farmers generally produce less food.

The fact is that organic farming simply does not produce the same volume of food as non-organic methods. The time is takes to grow food is also a lot longer. Organic production cannot rely on the chemicals used heavily in non-organic farming to enhance the growth rate of crops. Organic farmers must rely on more natural methods, which do not always guarantee the same mass scale of successful crop.

The same principle applies to the production of meat. Livestock must have access to open spaces, must be fed natural food and cannot be given growth hormones. This essentially means that less food is produced, but the quality of the meat is better and by buying organic you know you’re supporting animal welfare.
