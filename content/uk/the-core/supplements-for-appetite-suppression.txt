Losing weight is definitely one of the most common New Year’s resolutions, and no matter what diet you’ve chosen to reach your 2017 weight loss goals – trying to lose weight can be a struggle. However, there are supplements that will make your weight loss journey easier – such as appetite suppressants. Appetite suppressants can reduce hunger, make you feel full quicker when eating, and also keep you full for longer. This means you will automatically reduce your calorie intake and ultimately lose weight.

**Glucomannan**

Glucomannan is a water-soluble dietary fibre derived from the root of the Konjac plant. The Konjac plant is native to South East Asia, where it has been an important part of a traditional healthy diet for centuries. The Glucomannan fibre has an extremely high water holding capacity – it can hold up to 100 times its own water weight. This means that when you consume Glucomannan powder –which should always be consumed with plenty of water, it will absorb liquids in your stomach and create a viscous gel-like solution. This in turn, will make you feel full, and as such prevent overeating and unnecessary snacking.

Glucomannan can be taken either as **[powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/glucomannan-konjac-powder/bpb-gman-0000)** or in **[capsules](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/glucomannan-konjac-capsules/bpb-gman-500c)**, it can also be used to make foods like **[Diet Noodles](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/diet-udon-noodles/bpf-duno), [Diet Pasta](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/diet-pasta/bpf-dpas)** and [**Diet** **Rice**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/diet-rice/bpf-dric). Diet Noodles, Pasta and Rice are almost calorie-free (only 6kcal per 100g!), this makes them ideal for anyone on an energy restricted or low carb diet. The fact that they also provide 3g of Glucomannan per serving means they will help you feel full throughout the day. That’s two very good reasons to include them in your weight loss diet!

**Psyllium Husk Powder**

[Psyllium Husk Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/psyllium-husks-powder/bpb-phus-0000), being a high fibre product, works in a similar way to Glucomannan, but does not have the same water holding capacity. Psyllium Husk Powder will increase the bulk of your meal and slow down the movement of food through the digestive tract, hence keeping you full for longer.

**Caffeine**

Caffeine is widely used in weight loss products, and it’s well known that caffeine is a stimulant, but did you know that caffeine can also suppress appetite? That means some caffeine in the morning won’t just wake you up, it can also help you control hunger during the morning. A more convenient way of consuming caffeine, than making cups of coffee, is Caffeine Tablets. Our [caffeine tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/caffeine-tablets/bpb-caff-t000) contain 200mg of caffeine, which is equivalent to two cups of coffee.

**DL Phenylalanine**

DL Phenylalanine is a form of the essential amino acid Phenylalanine. DL Phenylalanine converts into the amino acid L-Tyrosine in the body. Tyrosine, in turn, can be converted into dopamine – the hormone known for being able to promote happy feelings. A drop in dopamine levels, which can occur when you start on a diet for instance, has been linked to increased appetite. Here’s where DL Phenylalanine can help to keep those dopamine levels high. Phenylalanine also stimulates the release of the appetite suppressing hormone cholecystokinin.

**Protein**

Keeping your protein intake high while on a diet is important for different reasons, one of them being the satiating properties of protein. It’s well established that under most conditions, protein is more satiating than carbohydrates and fat. Products like [**Informed** **Whey™**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/informed-whey/bpps-iwhe) and **[Pure Whey Isolate 90™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-isolate-90/bpb-wpi9-0000)** are both great choices if you’re looking for a protein that’s low in fat and carbohydrates.

**CUTTING EDGE™ – combining these supplements**

All of these supplements can be effective taken on their own, but for best results you want to combine some of them to get a synergist effect. In our **[Cutting Edge™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/cutting-edge/bpps-cedg)** capsules we have included both Glucomannan, Caffeine and Phenylalanine, as well as other powerful and research proven weight loss ingredients. This means you will experience a potent appetite suppressant effect, but also stimulate weight loss through other mechanisms.

Based on the concept of Cutting Edge™, we developed [**Cutting Edge Protein™**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/cutting-edge-protein/bpps-cepr) – our premium protein supplement for weight loss. The satiating effect of the high quality whey protein has been boosted by the addition of 1g of Glucomannan per serving, and just like Cutting Edge™ capsules it contains an array of key fat loss ingredients.

So why not give appetite suppressants a go? We think you’ll find it makes your weight loss resolution a whole lot easier to stick to.
