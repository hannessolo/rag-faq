Confused by different types of protein powder? Discover which protein isolate is best for you.

Although whey protein concentrate seems to dominate the protein powder market, there are actually numerous other types of protein powder to choose from – each with distinctive characteristics and benefits. One of the most popular protein powder choices is isolate. But what is an isolate, and why might it be the best choice for you?

**What is Protein Isolate?**
----------------------------

Protein isolate is a type of protein powder. Just like regular [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) (and non-whey protein), isolate is simply a powdered form of the original ingredient. But isolate is a different part of the base ingredient, and has different properties. Let’s focus on whey protein isolate as an example.

Whey is a dairy by-product (the other by-product is casein). The difference between whey isolate and regular whey concentrate is that isolate undergoes an extra stage of processing – called cross-flow microfiltration. This means that even more of the fat, lactose, and cholesterol is filtered out. The result is whey isolate: a purer form of whey, with less lactose, less carbohydrate, less fat, and of course more protein. The protein content of whey isolate is around 90%, compared to around 80% in whey concentrate.

Whey isolate is a popular choice with people who are watching every calorie and want to get more protein per serving. It is also a good choice for people who can eat dairy but are sensitive to lactose.

**4 Different Types of Protein Isolate**
----------------------------------------

### **1) Whey Protein Isolate**

Whey Protein Isolate is by far the most popular type of protein isolate because it offers all the nutritional benefits of whey (with high levels of key amino acids), but with even more protein and less carbohydrate. There’s [Pure Whey Isolate™ 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-isolate-90/bpb-wpi9-0000), with 27g protein per 30g serving and very low levels of carbs and fat.

Or you could go one step further with [Pure Whey Isolate™ 97](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-isolate-97/bpb-uwpi-0000) (the world’s purest whey protein) which has 23g BCAA per 100g and an amazing 99% of its calories from protein.

[Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hydrolysed-whey-protein-isolate/bpb-hwpi-0000) has been hydrolysed so your body can absorb it even more quickly.

And [Natural Pure Whey Isolate™ 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/natural-pure-whey-isolate-90/bpb-npwi) is made with completely natural ingredients (including Stevia as the sweetener) and still delivers 26g protein per serving.

### **2) Soy Protein Isolate**

But Whey Protein Isolate isn’t the only type of isolate on the market, which is good news for anyone who can’t eat dairy at all for ethical or digestive reasons.

[Soy Protein Isolate 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/soya-protein-isolate-90/bpb-spi9-0000) is a dairy-free and totally vegan-friendly isolate protein powder, which is really popular with vegans who want an isolate protein. It has over 27g protein per 30g serving and is high in arginine.

### **3) Super Pea Protein Isolate**

Another vegan option for a protein isolate is [Super Pea Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/super-pea-protein-isolate/bpb-sppi-0000). Pea protein is a great protein source for vegans or anyone who can’t use whey, and this isolate version is 50% more soluble than regular pea protein powder.

### **4) Beef Protein Isolate**

If you want an isolate that isn’t whey but doesn’t need to be vegan or vegetarian, you could try [HydroBEEF™ – Beef Protein Isolate 97](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef/bpb-hbee-0000). This isolate is made from premium beef protein and has an incredible 97% protein content. And, no, it does not taste meaty at all! It’s an incredible quality protein isolate with massive protein content.

**Which Isolate is Right for me?**

If you want to try a quality isolate protein powder, but don’t know what to choose, consider the following:
