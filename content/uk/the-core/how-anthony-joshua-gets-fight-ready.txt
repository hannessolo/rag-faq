Giving it all you got is our mantra in the gym. Who better to get tips from the two time world heavyweight champion? Ahead of his upcoming fight, we spoke with none other than team bulk™ icon Anthony Joshua (AJ) to see how he’s getting on and what his preparation looks like.

### **Hi AJ! How are you feeling in the lead up to the fight?**

I’m feeling good, both physically and mentally. I’m ready to get after it. 

### **How far in advance does your preparation start?** 

My preparation doesn’t stop. It started from the first time I put a pair of gloves on and the experience I have had since then has prepared me for the next fight. Around 12 weeks out from a fight my preparation becomes more specific as I go into training camp and focus on the next fight. 

### **Are there different phases of your training regime?**

I have a great team around me who structure my training phases around different workloads depending on which phase of the camp. I always keep myself ticking over outside of my training camps keeping my nutrition and training consistent.

Outside of camp we focus on improving boxing IQ and technique. When in training camp I then focus more on the opponent for the fight. Boxing is a sport that requires so many different types of fitness, strength, speed, endurance as well as controlling your mind so it is important to work in each area. 

### **How do your nutrition goals change throughout the year?** 

Being a heavyweight I don’t need to worry about my weight so I tend to keep my diet very consistent in and out of training camp. I work closely with my nutritionist and training team to ensure I am getting my macros right depending on the training load for that week to ensure I am properly fuelled and recovered.

### **What does your nutrition plan look like when getting in shape during training?**

When I am in training camp I can train up to 3 times a day so getting the right nutrition on board is vital. A blend of protein and carbohydrate shakes help me recover and give me the energy to keep training. I have [Informed Whey](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/informed-whey/bpps-iwhe) before training or with my breakfast and [Aftermath](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/aftermath/bpps-amat) after training for recovery. I eat 3/4 meals per day with protein and carb snacks in between. 

### **What is the most important part of the nutritional plan and how do you track how it’s going?**

Being heavyweight I am fortunate that I do not have to be a specific weight for my fights. With that said, it is still really important I get the right balance of macros, this plays a huge role in making sure I am fuelled for my training sessions and can give 100% and then be recovered to do this same thing the next day. 

### **Physically, how intense does training become?**

During my 12 week training camps I can train up to 3 times a day with boxing, S&C and running. The workload within each session is managed so I am able to give 100% but not burnout or get injuries. This is why recovery is just as important as the training itself. I need to make sure my nutrition and sleep is just as good as my training.

### **It must be a huge mental game. How do you mentally prepare for a fight?**

Mindset plays a huge role in boxing in different areas. There is the mental strength you need to motivate yourself everyday to get up and train and keep pushing. Then in boxing there are also the mental games you have with your opponent. You have to remember why you started and what the end goal is and that will give you the strength to keep pushing towards your goal. Yoga is a great way to relax the mind and gives you the time to stop and think about what it is you want to achieve and how. 

### **What’s it like 24 hours before a fight?**

By this point all the hard work is done and I am preparing mentally for the fight. I try to stay as relaxed as possible and visualise the different outcomes of the fight.

Good luck AJ team bulk™ will be cheering you on!
