This decadent recipe for choc chip cookies from #TeamBulk ambassador [@julien.bbr](http://www.instagram.com/julien.bbr) is a must for cheat days! Give it a go!

**Ingredients**

*   200g [Coconut Flour](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/flour)
*   5g baking powder
*   1 tablespoon cinnamon
*   Pinch of salt
*   10g [Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut)
*   20g [Zero Calorie Syrup Honey](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/zero-calorie-syrup/bpf-zcsy)
*   40g banana
*   25g dark chocolate, broken into small pieces
*   10g [Coconut Oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/organic-virgin-coconut-oil/bpf-ovco)
*   70g apple sauce
*   Water

**Instructions**

*   Get your oven on – preheat to 180C/350F
*   Mix all of your dry ingredients (flour, salt, cinnamon, baking powder) together in a bowl
*   Then add everything else, except the dark chocolate pieces, and mix thoroughly. Melting the coconut oil first could make it easier to mix!
*   Add a small amount of water at this stage if the dough is too thick
*   Use your hands to form the dough into small balls and place them on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, making sure you leave plenty of room between them
*   Add the chocolate pieces on top
*   Bake for 10 minutes
*   Let them cool once they’re out of the oven, then enjoy!
