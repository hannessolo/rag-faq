4.) For your muffin mix, add all your dry ingredients then your wet ingredients and using a whisk, mix vigorously.

5.) Line a muffin tray with muffin cases and check on your apples. they should have turned a golden rainbow of colours, with some more caramelised than others.

8.) Pop into hot oven for approximately 20 minutes.
