Some boys believe that if you kiss her, you turn into a Prince. Others believe her out-of-this-world-tasty high protein recipes are the key to lifelong happiness and well filled tummies.

All we know is she’s called **The Muscle Baker**, and this Valentine’s she’ll be romancing your tastebuds with this Raspberry Hearts Recipe.

### Instructions:

1.) In a saucepan, begin by heating up the milk on low heat, until it starts to smoke slightly. Then add gelatin sachets (one at a time) and whisk until completely dissolved.

2.) Then, whisk in the **VitaFiber™ Powder** scoop by scoop until dissolved.

3.) Mix in **LiquiFlav™** followed by **Whey Protein** and continue whisking until everything is combined.

4.) Pour into a measuring jug, and pour into your desired silicone mold of choice (in this case hearts).

_**Note:** we used a measuring jug to make it easier for us to pour directly into mold, however if you have ninja pouring skills, you can do so straight from saucepan._

_5.)_ Leave to set in fridge for upto 3 hours, or place in freezer for upto an hour.
