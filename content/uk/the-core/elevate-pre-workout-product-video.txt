### When should you take it?

[ELEVATE](../../shop-by-range/pro-series/elevate.html "ELEVATE")™ should be taken 30-45 minutes prior to training and ideally on an empty stomach to speed up the rate of absorption. Pre-workouts are a fantastic way to increase the focus and intensity of your training when you need a bit of a boost. Some people will use a pre-workout before each workout; others will take one as and when they feel like they need a lift. Try ELEVATE™ yourself – we’re confident you’ll notice an improvement in the quality of your workouts.
