2.) Beat the egg whites until very stiff and gently fold into the other ingredients

3.) Bake at 160° for about 40 minutes or until a golden. You can check if it’s done by inserting a toothpick into the cake, if it comes out clean it’s done. If not it needs a little longer.

4.) Allow it to rest in the switched off oven for about an hour
