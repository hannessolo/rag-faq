It may look like a trick, but get ready for a real treat with this Spider Smoothie Bowl Halloween Recipe.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.) Add all ingredients into your high speed blender or bullet, and pour into a bowl. Add a little more milk if your smoothie is still frozen and not mixing too well. (Some blenders may work better than others).

2.) Mix yoghurt and protein powders to get a thicker consistency, squeeze into a disposable piping bag, cut off the tip and make circle shapes ranging from a dot in the middle to larger (imagine a dart board).

3.) Then, with the tip of a sharp knife, make lines from the centre out to the edge of the bowl, to make the ‘spiderweb’ shape.

Yields 1 bowl.
