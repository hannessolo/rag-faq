Curcumin is a yellow pigment within the spice known as Turmeric (a member of the Ginger family). It’s a small molecule found within Turmeric which is often referred to as a curcumoid or a polyphenol.

This ingredient has been used in Ayurvedic Medicine for years, due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Whilst these touted benefits mean it is still widely used today – research continues to look for the range of benefits we can get from consumption or supplementation.
