Lisa-Jane, of [Wildcat Fitness](http://wildcatfitnessuk.com/), received several sachets of our high quality Strawberry [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™. With this she decided to create a healthy muffin recipe that you can enjoy as the perfect post workout refuel, or to satisfy your sweet tooth mid-morning (without worrying about the calories).

But despite having great macros, good nutritional benefits and being easy to make, Lisa-Jane’s favourite part is the fact the **Berry Protein Muffins** are pink! A protein treat to match her gym outfit – perfect!

Here’s how she made them:

### Method:

Pre-heat oven to 180c.

Mix all the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Once combined, add the liquid egg whites and stir well until a batter-like consistency is achieved. If the mixture still seems a little dry, feel free to add more egg whites. Stir well until you have a smooth mixture (protein powder can clump a little) and at that point, add your mixed berries – I used one small handful of goji and one small handful of blueberries.

Pour the mixture into muffin cases – the amount above made 12 mini muffins for me, if you are making larger muffins this mixture should create 6-8.

Place muffins into the oven and check every 5 minutes – if the tops are starting to brown before the muffins are cooked then turn the temperature down a little, or cover the muffins with tin foil. They should take 15-20 minutes to bake through.

Remove from the oven and enjoy your high protein, low fat, low sugar treat!
