### Summary

What better way to relax and unwind after a hard day, or brutal training session, than to indulge in a slice of this Coffee & Walnut Cake? Combining some impressive ingredients, this recipe delivers all the protein, carbs and fats you need to recover quickly, and the coffee kick will keep you feeling sharp too!

### Instructions

1.) In your [BULK POWDERS™ blender bottle](../../shop-by-category/accessories/shaker-bottles/blender-bottle-large.html "Blender bottle"), prepare your [Complete Protein Coffee](https://www.bulk.com/uk/collagen-coffee.html "Complete Protein Coffee")™ (white) up to 200ml, add ½ Tsp [Coconut Oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "Coconut Oil") and stir until dissolved. Then, preheat oven to 180 degrees.

2.) Add your dry ingredients into a bowl, followed by the wet ingredients, adding eggs first, followed by the coffee. (If you would like more walnuts inside your cake as well as your topping, add them to your mix.)

3.) Pour into a round silicone mould and bake in the oven for approx. 20-30minutes, until baked yet soft and springy to the touch. Double check by inserting a sharp knife or stick, if it comes out sticky then it needs baking for longer.

4.) Remove from oven when done and leave to cool.

5.) For frosting, mix Quark and Whey together to get a thick creamy consistency, add the coconut oil and stir in. If you like thicker, add more whey.

6.) Lather over your cooled cake base (make sure it has cooled down fully), sprinkle the walnuts and pop in fridge for approx. half an hour to let the cream set.
