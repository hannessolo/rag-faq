There were a few great launches in November. From some new additions to our clothing range to a brand new organic range, here is a round-up**:  
**

**Muscle Fit T-Shirt and Muscle Fit Stringer Vest**

Over the next few months you will begin to see some nice additions to the BULK POWDERS™ clothing range. To kick things off we have launched two fantastic garments which include our [Muscle Fit Stringer Vest](../../muscle-fit-stringer-vest.html) and [Muscle Fit T-Shirt](../../muscle-fit-tshirt.html). Both uniquely designed and individually hand printed in the UK to offer the most comfortable and stylish threads around – and unbeatable value too!

**Hazelnut Butter 1KG**

To add to our current range of nut butters we have added the popular [Hazelnut Butter](../../hazelnut-butter.html). One of the first of this type on the market, Hazelnut Butter is sourced from 100% Hazelnuts. Yes, that’s right – no added preservatives, sugar, salt or palm oil, this makes it an excellent addition to your diet.

**Organic Range**

At BULK POWDERS™ we realise that having the right product range for our customers is one thing, but we also understand that the quality of these products is fundamental and this plays a key role in consumer choices.

That’s why we have recently launched our Organic Range which is certified by the Soil Association. This means that any product carrying the Soul Association logo is organically certified and meets the highest standards of sustainability and quality.

The range currently includes; [Raw Cacao Nibs](../../organic-raw-cacao-nibs.html), [Virgin Coconut Oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html), and [Cacao](../../organic-cacao-powder.html), [Baobab](../../organic-baobab-powder.html), [Moringa](../../organic-moringa-powder.html), and [Lucuma Powder](../../organic-lucuma-powder.html) – three great additions with many different uses.

**Chia Seed Muffin Mix**

If you enjoy home baking then BULK POWDERS™ Chia Seed Muffin Mix is the perfect product for you. Packing in all the key ingredients for delicious home-baked muffins, they are super easy to make and can be prepared and baked in just 30 minutes. Baking has never been so simple! Packing over 60g of protein, low in sugar yet high in fibre, these muffins are the perfect addition to your cupboard, or are fantastic for showing off your baking skills.
