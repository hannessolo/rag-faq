### Summary

This is already proving to be a very popular dessert. With so many flavours combined, the Banoffee Millionaire Protein Flapjacks are going down a storm! Simple and tasty. Gains all round!

### Instructions to make the flapjacks:

1.) Melt coconut oil and peanut butter over a gentle heat. Once melted together remove from the heat & add the mashed banana followed by all other remaining ingredients.

2.) Pack the mixture tightly into a lined baking tin approx 1 inch thick.

3.) Bake at 180’c for 20 mins or until light golden brown.

4.) Allow to cool before cutting into bars.

### Instructions to make the banoffee & chocolate layers:

1.) Squash all three flapjacks into a small greased and lined baking tray approx 2cm thick.

2.) Mix the [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html "Pure Whey Protein")™ with a splash of water, add little by little until you have a very thick, sticky and spreadable paste.

3.) Spread over the flapjack layer and pop in the fridge for 5 mins to harden up slightly.

4.) Melt the chocolate in the microwave (carefully!) or over a bowl of hot water.

5.) Pour the melted chocolate over the ‘caramel’ layer and gently spread out so it reaches the edges.

6.) Chill in the fridge for 5-10 minutes until the chocolate cools but is still soft. This makes it easier to cut into squares!

7.) Once cut put back in the fridge to fully harden the chocolate.
