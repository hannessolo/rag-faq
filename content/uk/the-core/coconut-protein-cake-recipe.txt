Delicious Gluten free Coconut Protein Cake that’s high in protein, low in fat, sugar free, and can be dairy-free (if vegan protein is used). Free of a lot but full of taste! (how cheesy does that sound?)

**INSTRUCTIONS**
----------------

1.) Preheat the oven to 350F/180C and line two 7.5” (or 8”) cake pans with parchment paper and spray with non-stick spray.

2.) In a small bowl, sift together the coconut flour, ultra fine Scottish oats, protein powder, baking powder, baking soda , stevia and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg whites, milk, yogurt and extracts.

3.) Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and whisk together until smooth. You may need to add more or less water depending on what flour you have used – it will be thick but pourable. Leave to stand for about 2 minutes – the batter will thicken up a bit.

4.) Whisk in the vinegar, then immediately pour into the prepared cake pans.

5.) Bake in a preheated oven for approximately 18-22 minutes (if using 8” pans it will be done in about 18 minutes) or until golden, well risen and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

6.) Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before frosting.

**For the Frosting**
--------------------

1.) In a large bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt and stevia.

2.) Add the protein powder 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking between each addition.

3.) Frost the cake!
