In the cold winter months, there’s no better breakfast than a hearty bowl of steaming porridge (in our opinion). Oh yes. Not only is this the cosiest breakfast imaginable, oats are super healthy too. High in vitamins and soluble fibre, oats release their energy slowly throughout the day, helping you to feel satisfied. 

And the joy doesn’t end there.. There are so many ways to pimp up your porridge. And if you’re looking for some fresh ideas, here are five healthy porridge toppings to revitalise your winter breakfast. So get your bowl out, and heat up the stove. It’s time to mix things up.

**1) NUTS & SEEDS**
-------------------

Nutty about nutrition? Then look no further than our [**nuts and seeds**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nuts-seeds.html). Nuts are a source of fibre, with the fibre contents of almonds and hazelnuts being particularly high. Increasing the amount of fibre consumed in your diet is not only beneficial for digestion, but also helps to curb those cravings and sustain your energy levels throughout your day.

Whether nuts are a good option to use to top your porridge depends on personal goals. Nuts are naturally high in fat, which make them great for bulking or any mass gain programme. They’re also incredibly nutritious, meaning they’re perfect for people looking to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. However, the high-calorie nature means they may not be the best option for sustaining a caloric deficit.

Moving onto seeds, [**Sunflower Seeds**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/sunflower-seeds/bpf-sunf) and [**Chia Seeds**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chia-seeds.html) make amazing protein porridge toppings. Both are sources of protein, which contributes to the growth and maintenance of muscle mass. Again, the fat content of these is fairly high.

**2) DRIED FRUITS**
-------------------

Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, topping your porridge with our selection of [**Dried Fruits**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/dried-fruits.html) is a great way to help reach your five-a-day and increase your fibre intake. 

Want some fruity protein? [**Dried Goji Berries**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dried-goji-berries/bpf-goji) are a tasty choice if you’re looking for a boost. Not only are they a source of protein, our Goji Berries contain only sugars that occur naturally in the fruit, which means there’s  no added sugar. If you’ve got a sweet tooth, [**Dried Apricots**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods) and [**Dried Cranberries**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dried-cranberries/bpf-cran) are sure to hit the spot, while giving you a good dose of antioxidants.

**3) TOASTED COCONUT FLAKES**
-----------------------------

Deliciously nutty with a delicate crunch, our new [**Toasted Coconut Flakes**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods) are ideal for sprinkling some nutritional, wholefood goodness into your porridge. If you’re looking to control your sugar intake, these are a great option as they’re low in sugar and high in fibre. 

When coconut is toasted, it takes on a deeper flavour, more woody with a slight hint of vanilla. A perfect accompaniment for a warm bowl in front of the fireplace. Yum.

**4) PROTEIN BARS**
-------------------

Is there anything more satisfying than cutting protein bars up into tiny little cubes? (Maybe that’s just us.) Add some extra excitement to your morning and top them on your porridge. 

If a morning protein boost is what you’re after, then look no further than our classic [MACRO MUNCH™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-biscuits/mmun-bisc) [**Protein Bar**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-biscuits/mmun-bisc). High in protein, with at least 20g protein per bar, and low in sugar, it’s an easy way to reach your daily protein target without consuming unnecessary sugars. 

If you’d rather go for a vegan-friendly porridge topping option, our [**Gourmet Vegan Bar**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/gourmet-vegan-bar/vser-vgba) or [**Protein Balls**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein-balls.html) are also excellent choices to help with your muscle-building goals. Or if you’d like to go for a cookie crumble porridge vibe, smash and sprinkle some of our [**Protein Biscuits**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/macro-munch-protein-biscuits.html) onto your porridge. Seriously, you need to try it.

**5) THE DRIZZLE**
------------------

Saving the best for last? That’s for you to decide. From peanut butter to tasty syrups, a liquid-based topping adds a new richness and texture. And with most of our [**nut butters**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters.html) and [**protein spreads**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/protein-spreads/bpf-pspr) being classified as sources of protein, these are easy and delicious ways to increase your consumption. 

What’s more, we only use naturally occurring sugars. This means you aren’t incorporating unnecessary sugars into your diet, which is a common issue with many mainstream spreads currently sold in supermarkets. Our butters and spreads are also free from palm oil, unlike supermarket alternatives, allowing you to make the sustainable choice.

If you are looking for a low-calorie porridge topping, our [**Zero Calorie Syrups™**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/zero-calorie-syrup/bpf-zcsy) are a great guilt-free alternative to the sugar-filled syrups you find in the supermarket. An incredible way to add flavour without loading up on calories, our syrups contain zero fat, zero sugar and _zero_ calories. What’s not to like?
