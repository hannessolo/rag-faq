Want a quick fix for your hunger pangs? This Sweet Potato & Spinach Frittata by [The Muscle Bakery](https://themusclebakery.com/) couldn’t be easier – in the pan, bake, voilà! Dinner is served.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.) Preheat oven to 170 Degrees C.

2.) Whisk together the egg whites, salt, pepper, paprika and mixed Italian herbs.

3.) Using a cast iron pan, or even a standard pan (which can be placed in a hot oven) place sweet potato and spinach as neatly or roughly as you please.

4.) Pour egg mix into pan, then with the tip of a knife and your finger, slide bits of soft cheese onto different areas of the pre-frittata.

5.) Sprinkle a few more herbs over the top, and even a drizzle of olive oil if you’re feeling fancy.

6.) Bake for 15-20 mins until egg has cooked through.

\*Recommended recipe for [sweet potato slices](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/baked-potato-wedges-recipe/) or you can use pre-made frozen slices.
