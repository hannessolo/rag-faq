On Saturday 16th November, Matt Argall followed up his recent win at the NPA British Championships with a win at the UIBBN World Championships in Paris.

Matt travelled to Paris full of confidence, after successfully defending his NPA British Lightweight title. The NPA is a lifetime drug free federation – tested by urinalysis as well as polygraph testing. Matt arrived in Paris on Friday evening and found that he was in a class of 13 competitors, including the defending 2012 champion from France.

Show day was a long day, with the pre-judging in the morning and the evening show…well, in the evening! After the pre-judging, Matt wasn’t sure where he was likely to place. The judges call outs made it difficult to tell, so it was all to play for in evening show where the individual routines take place.

As the results were announced, the home favourite and defending champion was called out in 5th place. 4th, 3rd and 2nd went by and then an ecstatic Matt was announced as the winner and UIBBN Bantamweight World Champion!  
Summarising his year, Matt beamed “totally over the moon with the win! Firstly, to consolidate my Brits win proving it wasn’t a fluke and then to nail the Worlds. To go one better than last year’s 2nd place at the Worlds is fantastic! To do it in an even bigger and tougher class than last year makes it even more rewarding. In some ways, the pressure I put on myself was immense, but that’s just me I guess!

Congratulations, Matt, from all at [BULK POWDERS™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/)! Matt Argall: 2x British and World Champion!
