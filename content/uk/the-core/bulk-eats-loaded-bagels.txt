Now, this Loaded Bagels recipe is a brunch idea we can get behind! Dense, chewy and delicious, bagels are the perfect quick and easy meal. They’re also super-easy to carry around, making them a convenient option for on-the-go snacking any time of the day. The beauty of a bagel is that it can be topped with just about anything and be fully tailored to suit your taste. Our pick would be a generous coating of our [Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/peanut-butter-1kg.html) to pack in the protein, a banana and some blueberries – for that sweet and salty hit. Add a pinch of cinnamon for some spice and you’re ready to go!

Ingredients:

*   1 bagel
*   2 tbsp of [Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/peanut-butter-1kg.html)
*   1 banana
*   Handful of blueberries
*   Pinch of cinnamon

Method:

*   Cut the bagel in half and toast
*   Top with peanut butter, banana and blueberries
*   Sprinkle with cinnamon and enjoy!
