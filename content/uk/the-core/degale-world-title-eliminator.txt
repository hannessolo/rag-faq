2014 has started with good news for BULK POWDERS™ ambassador James DeGale MBE. The WBC has ordered a final eliminator between James (the WBC Silver Champion) and undefeated Badou Jack. This means the winner goes on to fight for the prestigious WBC title – often referred to in boxing as ‘the famous green belt’ due to the history and status of the title. The current WBC Super-Middleweight Champion is the tough, experienced Sakio Bika.

Jack, who fights under the Mayweather Promotions banner, is a dangerous opponent with 11 of his 16 wins coming by KO. Jack fought to a draw with Marco Antonio Periban, who DeGale was initially scheduled to fight.

James’ promoter Mick Hennessey has put an offer into Mayweather Promotions for the fight to take place in London on March 1st 2014. An excited DeGale said “I just want to get in the ring and fight for the chance to win the world title. I just hope Jack doesn’t do a Periban and we get the fight on as soon as possible.”

James has done things the traditional way, winning the ABA Title, Olympic Gold Medal, British Title, European Title and the WBC Silver Title and he feels 100% confident in taking things to the next level.
