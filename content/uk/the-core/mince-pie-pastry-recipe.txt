### Summary

What kind of Christmas would Christmas be without a suitable protein-powered Mince Pie Pastry recipe? Mince pie’s are the daddy, right? Well these are not only pleasing to the palate, but they are healthier than the supermarket imposters too! Have a substantially-fantastic Christmas with these treats!

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 180C.

2.) Combine the dry ingredients for the pastry in a bowl. Melt the coconut oil in the microwave and stir in the agave syrup.

3.) In a small food processor, add the dry ingredients. Add the coconut oil-agave mix and blitz to combine. Add the egg and blitz again. Roll the mix into a ball. Allow to sit while you put together the filling.

4.) Chop up the dried fruit. Add to a sauce pan along with the remaining ingredients apart from the whey. Bring to the boil and allow to simmer until the fruit has soaked up the liquid and is soft. You may need to add more liquid as you go. Once soft, simmer to drive off any excess liquid. Stir in the whey.

5.) Roll out your pastry between two pieces of grease proof paper. Use a cutter to cut 4 large rounds for the bottom, and a star cutter for 4 stars for the topping. You may have some left over pastry. Lightly oil a mince pie tin.

6.) Put the mince pie ‘bottoms’ in the tin and add a spoon of the mince pie filling. Top with the star. Repeat to make 4 mince pies. For a bit of a ‘finish’ brush the tops with a little melted coconut oil, and sprinkle over cinnamon sugar. Pop in the oven and bake for about 6 minutes until golden.

**Tip:** try adding a blob of sweetened cream cheese for cream cheese mince pies.
