When The Beltsander isn’t attempting to play swingball with a golf club or drinking the entire menu at his favourite cocktail bar, he can usually be found in the kitchen creating magic.

Here’s his latest innovation, a festive Christmas high protein eggnog drink featuring our Cinnamon Extract Powder, Whey Protein, Egg Whites and Zero Calorie Syrup (sugar free).

### Instructions:

1.) Add all the ingredients to a blender

2.) Blitz for about a minute. Liquid egg whites are pasteurised so they’re perfectly safe to drink without being cooked.

3.) Drink as is or, as it’s Christmas, add a splash of rum. Or a lot of rum….. Or enough rum to blind a small pirate, the choice is yours.
