The inclusion of ingredients such as caffeine and taurine are commonplace in popular [pre workout supplements](http://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/pre-workout) and for good reason. There is a lot of research to support their performance benefits, particularly if you are strength training.

However, the issue arises when your training schedule falls outside of the norm. If you train late at night, a pre workout supplement that contains caffeine can be problematic and impact sleep quality. Interrupted, poor quality sleep is a sure-fire way to feel unrested and unmotivated, and no one wants that. 

### **YOU DON’T NEED CAFFEINE TO HAVE A GREAT WORKOUT.**

If you train in the morning, a caffeine supplement or pre workout containing caffeine could be exactly what you need.

However, I think we’ve determined you’re looking for something else. An alternative that will still allow you to perform in the gym and have a great workout, but without the associated buzz that keeps you up all night and leaves you feeling tired the next day.

### **CAFFEINE FREE** **PRE-WORKOUT™**

Our product team had the task of creating a caffeine free pre workout supplement, and they have. Rather than simply taking an existing formulation and removing the caffeine they have reformulated our popular [caffeine free pre-workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-pre-workout-caffeine-free/bble-cpcf) to create something pretty powerful.

Out goes the 200mg caffeine and 400mg l-tyrosine for starters. You don’t want this if you’re banking on some beauty sleep.

### **BUT HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE PERFORMANCE EDGE WITHOUT THE BUZZ?**

The team reviewed the existing dosages. Complete Pre-Workout™ is a popular supplement and the ingredients list is impressive but the challenge for the new caffeine free version was to try to maintain, or supersede, the performance benefits of the original – minus the caffeine.

Dosages of both Beta Alanine and Citrulline Malate have been increased to an impressive 3g each. Ever present in pre workout formulas, these guys are the fatigue fighters. When you’re working out and trying to power through a set, the last thing you want is for ‘the burn’ to kick in ahead of schedule. [Beta Alanine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/beta-alanine/bpb-bala-0000) and Citrulline Malate help to preserve muscle pH and acidity levels – delaying the build-up of lactic acid and muscle fatigue.

3g of Creatine Monohydrate has been added to increase physical performance in short, high intensity bursts of exercise. Think sprinting, weightlifting, any explosive movement that requires a supply of ATP. Creatine is also believed to have an effect on brain power, specifically our ability to focus and recall information. So whilst caffeine has been removed, Creatine may support brain function and focus.

### **WHAT ELSE WAS INCLUDED?**

We’ve added 700mg Choline Bitartrate. This is part of the B-complex vitamin family and is used by nerve cells to manufacture a chemical called acetylcholine, which effectively allows cells to communicate with each other. By increasing the efficiency of communication pathways to the brain, Choline Bitartrate is thought to aid muscle contractions and movement, as well as assisting coordination.

And not forgetting Vitamin B6 and Electrolytes which have both been included to help maintain performance levels whilst training. [Vitamin B](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamins/vitamin-b) contributes to a reduction in tiredness and fatigue, ideal with the exclusion of caffeine.
