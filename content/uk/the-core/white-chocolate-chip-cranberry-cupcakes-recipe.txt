White Chocolate Chip Cranberry Cupcakes, made with White Chocolate Pure Whey Protein™.

Instructions
------------

1.) Preheat the oven to 375F/190C and line a cupcake tin with 10 liners – or just spray the tin. If using paper liners – spray them with non-stick spray.

2.) In a large bowl, sift together the flour, protein, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

3.) In a medium sized bowl, mix together the egg whites, yogurt, xylitol, extracts and mashed banana. I used an electric mixer to smooth out banana lumps – but you can do it with a whisk, fork or spoon.

4.) Slowly add wet ingredients to dry, and mix until well combined. Mix until most of the lumps of flour are gone. Batter is quite thick. Fold in cherries and chocolate chips.

5.) Divide the batter amongst the liners.

6.) Bake in a preheated oven for about 18 minutes.

7.) These may seem underdone when you first remove them – but don’t over bake. They firm up as they cool.

\*To rehydrate the cherries, soak in water and microwave on medium heat for about 30 seconds (stop halfway through and give them a stir). You can, alternatively, use fresh cherries.
