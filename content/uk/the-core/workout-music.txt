Training Music
--------------

The team here at BULK HQ are keen musicians. We love nothing more than rocking out to Beethoven on a Friday evening down the gym – getting a serious swole on for those weekend gains. But when we’re not listening to classics, you might find us on Spotify creating mind-blowing playlists. We were the first sports nutrition company in the UK to come up with the idea, it made sense to us, music and training fit.

Bear witness to music that will surely make you stronger…

**Attention**: You will need to be logged into Spotify to listen to the playlists. Playlists are scrollable.

### The Rock/Metal Playlist

### The Hip Hop/R&B Playlist

### The Club Classics Playlist

### The Punk Playlist

### Christmas Playlist

### Summer Sessions Playlist
