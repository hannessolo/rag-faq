Let’s face it, the same plain oats each morning can get a bit dull! This recipe from [@healthyliciousvegan](http://www.instagram.com/healthyliciousvegan) packs in seeds and fruit to give you a hit of fibre and flavour. The cinnamon also gives the oats a delicious warming feel, which is definitely needed now that the mornings are getting colder!

**Ingr****edie****nts**

*   1/2 cup [chia seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/chia-seeds/bpf-chia)
*   1/2 cup ground flax seeds
*   3 cups of [Ultra Fine Scottish Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ultra-fine-scottish-oats/bpb-oats-0000)
*   1/2 cup [dried cranberries](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dried-cranberries/bpf-cran)
*   A handful of dried apricots (chopped)
*   1/2 cup xylitol (a low-calorie, natural alternative to sugar)
*   1 tsp of cinnamon

**Instructions**

*   This is a simple one, Team Bulk! Mix together your oats, seeds and xylitol and warm in the microwave or a pan on the hob for a couple of minutes with either water or your choice of milk
*   Once the liquid has been absorbed and you’ve got the porridge to a consistency you’re happy with, top with fruit and sprinkle over the cinnamon
*   Devour. Then go out and tackle the day!
