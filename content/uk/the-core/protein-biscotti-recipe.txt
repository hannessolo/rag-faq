Some say tectonic plates don’t actually exist and that the main cause of earthquakes across the globe are stomach rumbles from seeing his recipes. Others say his bowel movements cause geological catastrophes with blame put towards his famous daily meal plan ‘Use Vitafiber™ With Everything’. All we know is, he’s called The Beltsander.

Whilst Mrs Beltsander puts her feet up in front of the TV to watch The Great Irish Bake Off, Mr Beltsander gets to work in his man cave creating recipes no one else dares to dream of. Protein Biscotti dipped in chocolate, say no more.

### Instructions:

1.) Heat the water and the Vitafiber™ Powder in pan on a low heat. Keep whisking the mixture until it turns transparent

2.) In a dry bowl, mix the remaining ingredients

3.) Pour the Vitafiber™ into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix to form a stiff dough (if it seems too dry you can add a little water to loosen it)

4.) Shape the dough into a loaf shape and bake for 10 minutes at 180ºC

5.) When it’s golden and solid, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool completely before cutting it

6.) Cut into long strips and return the Protein Biscotti to the oven for a further 5-10 minutes turning once half way through

7.) Allow the Protein Biscotti to cool before serving (when it cools it will turn brittle)
