Don’t miss out on your weighted training with this full-body home workout with bag from our #TeamBulk ambassador Alex Cleland. No dumbbells required. Simply grab objects of a certain weight you may have around the house – think water bottles and big books. If you have access to a scale, you can even weight whatever you choose to put in your backpack to try and reach the same weight you’d be lifting in the gym.

Backpack Reverse Lunge
----------------------

Reverse lunges aren’t only great for hamstrings and glutes but, they also challenge your core and stability. Try and maintain a neutral centre of gravity is to equally train both of your legs without extra strain on either side. We recommend completing 4 sets of 12 reps for each leg.

![backpack reverse lunge step 1](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/backpack-split-squat-step-2.jpg)

1.  Start in a standing position with the rucksack on your back.
2.  Choose your standing leg and bend it slightly as you take a step backwards with the other leg.

1.  With your standing leg now bent at a 90° angle, make sure that your knee doesn’t go over your toes. Same rules apply to your back leg with the exception that your knee will be hovering off the floor.
2.  Pause in the lunge position then push with your back leg to stand up and go back to the original standing position.
3.  Repeat the exercise on the same leg to complete your reps and sets before moving onto the other leg.

One-arm Backpack Row
--------------------

Leaving your lower body to take a break for a while, let’s focus on your back. This exercise is great for your lat muscles and it also works arms and shoulders. Have a go at completing 3 sets with 15 reps each.

1.  Keep your legs shoulder-width apart with one leg in front of the other and soft knees. Hold your backpack from both straps with a straight arm and back. Use your free arm to maintain stability.
2.  With your core and back engaged, start lifting the backpack towards your shoulder.

1.  Your arm should now be at a 90° angle and you can pause in this position keeping the backpack lifted.
2.  Lower the backpack as you straighten your arm and get ready to lift it again.

Backpack Squat
--------------

The squat is just a classic lower body exercise and of course, it’s part of this home workout. Just like other squats performed without any weights, backpack squats work your hamstring, glutes and quads with the extra weight challenge. Have a go at completing 3 rounds of 15 reps each and see how you fare. If this is too easy, you can always increase your reps.

![backpack squat step 2](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/backpack-squat-step-2.jpg)

1.  Start in a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart and backpack on your chest.
2.  Hold the backpack with your hands and start bending your knees to reach the squat position.

![backpack squat step 4](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/backpack-squat-step-4.jpg)

![backpack squat step 5](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/backpack-squat-step-5.jpg)

1.  As you reach your maximum low, hold the position making sure that your knees don’t go over your toes.
2.  Start pushing up with your legs and glutes engaged to return to the initial standing position.
