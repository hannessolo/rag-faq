Each Chia Ball has less than 130 calories and plenty of fibre to give your nutritional intake a boost.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.) Empty the contents of the fruit, nut and seed mix into a large bowl.

2.) Pour enough boiling water over the mix to cover and set aside for 5 minutes â€“ this will soften the dried fruit.

3.) Drain the water from the mix and transfer to a food processor. Blitz until a sticky paste is formed.

4.) Stir in the ground almonds until ingredients are combined.

5.) Take roughly 2 tablespoons of the mixture and roll into a ball using your hands _(\*warning\* this gets messy)._

6.) Roll in the chia seeds to coat and repeat with the rest of the mixture.
