### Summary

An absolute protein-powerhouse; take a bow for this Pistachio Cheesecake recipe. 17.2g of protein per serving _**and**_ delicious. You’d be nuts not to give this a try…

### Instructions

You will need a spring form pan of some sort for this recipe, I usually line the bottom of the pan with greaseproof baking paper to make it easier to move around the finished product.

1.) Mix your [coconut oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "Coconut Oil"), agave, applesauce, flax, ground almonds, casein and pistachio butter until you have a mouldable doughy consistency. Press this into the bottom of your pan and place in fridge.

2.) Combine the Greek yoghurt, soft cheese and whey in a bowl and set aside.

3.) In a pan, heat up almond milk, not boiling hot, just hot enough to mix in your gelatin. Once you see the heat rising from the milk, start whisking in your gelatin until fully dissolved. Alternatively, you can also do this in the microwave.

4.) Add you dissolved gelatin mix into the vanilla/yoghurt/cheese mix and whisk thoroughly.

5.) Pour over your cheesecake base and wait patiently for approximately 4-5 hours (or overnight.) Checking the fridge every 5 minutes between those hours is not advised, but will give you a good arm workout at the very least.

We made some raspberry coulis to pour over it and was delicioso!
