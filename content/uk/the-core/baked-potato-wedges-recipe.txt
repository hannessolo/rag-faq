When she’s not on her scooter or getting up at 5am to do some yoga as the sun rises over the Rock of Gibraltar, Elke can usually be found in her food pantry surrounded by peanut butter. Occasionally she’ll put down the spoon and try a recipe such as this one – Baked Potato Wedges. It’s simple yet very effective with her clever choice of seasoning combining with coconut oil to create a nice crispy finish.

Enjoy alongside a fresh home made [protein pizza](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/margherita-pizza-recipe-for-two/).

### Instructions:

1.) Pre-heat oven to 180 Degrees C and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.

2.) Mix all your ingredients in a bowl and using your hands, thoroughly mix it all together, massaging the seasoning into the potatoes.

3.) Place seasoned potatoes onto tray and bake for up to 45-50 minutes, turning potatoes every once in a while to ensure thorough baking.

4.) Once potatoes have become golden and crisp on the outside, but soft to the touch they are ready.

5.) Remove from oven and leave to cool (as they will be scorching)

Enjoy on their own like we did (they were inhaled too quick for us to enjoy with anything), with your favourite dish OR make them in bulk and store away to enjoy every day!
