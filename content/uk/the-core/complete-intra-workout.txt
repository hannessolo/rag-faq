Complete Intra-Workout™
-----------------------

So, you already have your [Pre-Workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/complete-series/complete-pre-workout.html) and [Post-Workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/complete-series/complete-all-in-one.html) sorted but the question is, what are you doing about your [Intra-Workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/complete-series/complete-intra-workout.html)? Most people will take a pre and post-workout supplements to aid their training and recovery, but it seems there is vagueness around what to take during your workout to increase protein synthesis, enhance your performance, reduce muscle breakdown and delay fatigue.

What is Complete Intra-Workout™?
--------------------------------

BULK POWDERS™ Complete Intra-Workout™ is formulated with the following ingredients:

*   BCAA (10g)
*   L-Glutamine (3.5g)
*   Citrulline Malate (2g)

It contains the key ingredients vital for use during your workout and our notable 3:1:1 ratio of BCAA with 6g of Leucine makes ours stand out from the rest on the market. This unique formula is also instantised for very easy mixing and comes in 3 refreshing flavours to compliment your heavy training sessions.

What does Complete Intra-Workout™ do?
-------------------------------------

Performance

Citrulline Malate will detoxify ammonia that builds up in your muscles during exercise, helping you maintain your training intensity and avoid fatigue.

Reduce Muscle Breakdown

When your aim is to gain muscle mass, the main thing you need to avoid is potential muscle breakdown. BCAA supplementation has been shown to not only increase protein synthesis but to also reduce muscle protein breakdown, resulting in you successfully preserving all your hard work.

Increase Muscle Growth

Muscle growth is important to almost all athletes, as it ultimately means increased strength and power. Studies have shown even 2g of Glutamine to aid hypertrophy; we have used a 3.5g dose to supplement even the toughest training sessions.

Aid Recovery

Our impressive 3:1:1 ratio of BCAA with 6g of Leucine will help prevent Delayed Onset of Muscle Soreness (DOMS) which can impair recovery and your next training session. Again Glutamine also plays an important role in recovery, due to the fact that training leaves you with low levels of glutamine, which seriously affects your performance.

Quantity & Timing
-----------------

Drink Complete Intra-Workout during your exercise sessions, ensuring you mix with 500ml of water to keep you well hydrated.

**Summary**
-----------

You can now relate to an Intra-Workout and why it is as beneficial as a Pre and Post-Workout supplement. All three of our products play a vital role in the completion of a successful training session and will give you the complete package to aid your training. BULK POWDERS™ have given you a superior Intra-Workout formula, standing out from the rest with a 3:1:1 ration of BCAAs and important dosages that will actually make a difference to your overall athletic performance.
