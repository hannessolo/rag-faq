September has officially arrived and that means the very last days of summer 2019 are upon us. But don’t worry, we’re going to give you the lowdown on how to make the most of the final precious days of sunshine.

**Get those outside workouts in**

Let’s face it, working out outside during the winter just isn’t fun. Cling onto these last rays of sunshine and go for a run, do some circuit training or just go for a stroll. You’ll get a hearty dose of vitamin D and get your heart pumping. It’s a win win.

**Up your protein game with one last BBQ**

We reckon you might just have time to squeeze in one more BBQ. So, stock up on chicken, burgers and halloumi and enjoy that delicious protein hit.

**Get your hands on the last of the seasonal fruit and veg**

Strawberries, blackberries, spring onions, fresh courgettes… make the most of seasonal fruits and vegetables by making soup, crumbles, stir fry. The list is endless!
