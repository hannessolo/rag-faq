We’ve been busy in the BULK kitchen recently with bloggers [Healthy Twenties](http://www.healthytwenties.co.uk/) & [Charley’s Health](http://charleyshealth.co.uk/) creating lots of delicious healthy and protein-filled recipe for you to try at home.

Product of the Month
--------------------

Our [Ultra Fine Scottish Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html) take the crowning glory this month, and it’s no wonder! Packed with goodness, they taste great, are low GI, high in fibre and contain over 10% protein while being 100% natural.

Our Scottish Oats are a premium source of quality carbohydrates. Although they are typically consumed at breakfast, Oats are more versatile than you think. They are ideal for combining with [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein.html) to create your own meal replacements and weight gain formulas. Oats make an ideal source of calories for those looking to increase muscle mass.

From cookies to cakes, Ground Oats can be used in lots of baking and cooking recipes. They also make the perfect pancakes as shown below!

Here’s some inspiration and ideas to get your taste buds tingling…
