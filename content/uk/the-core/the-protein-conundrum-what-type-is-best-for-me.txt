Getting enough protein in your daily diet is critical for every goal, from building muscle and losing fat to maintaining metabolism as we get older. But what kind of protein is really best?

Why Protein?
------------

Protein is one of the three macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) and it should be a central part of everyone’s daily diet. As a basic cornerstone of nutrition, protein supports muscle growth, helps retain healthy lean tissue, keeps us stronger, and even supports our metabolic rate – which is important as we get older. Getting enough protein can also make the difference between being hungry, and feeling full and satiated by the meals you eat.

### How Much Protein Is Enough?

Whilst there’s no need to go overboard, you do need to keep an eye on your protein intake. Active people should aim for between 0.7g and 1g of protein per pound of body weight. Remember, that’s a gram of the macronutrient itself, not a gram of the food weight. For example, 100g chicken breast contains about 30g of protein.

So, a 150lb female would aim for 100-150g of protein per day and a 180lb male would be looking at approximately 125-180g of protein.

### Match Your Protein To Your Goals

So, now you’ve worked out how much protein to eat every day for your body weight, size, activity levels and goals, it’s time to look at where you’ll get that protein from. It is useful to plan main meals to include lean meat, poultry, red meat or game, eggs, dairy, fish and seafood. But what about quick snacks, pre and post-workout options, and bedtime protein? Here are some of our favourites.

Choose your goal:

### **B**oost your protein intake using quality protein with minimal fat/carbs

**Choose: [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000)**

Low in fat and carbs, with 82% whey protein concentrate, this is our most popular whey protein. It comes in 18 flavours (more to come in time!) making it a great choice for drinking as a shake, adding to oats or using in your protein cooking experiments.
