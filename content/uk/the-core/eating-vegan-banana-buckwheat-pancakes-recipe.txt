Next up on our Eating Vegan series with Lucy Watson, we’ve got this tasty Banana and Buckwheat [protein pancake recipe](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/pancake-day/). They’re an all-American classic, ideal for a rich breakfast or brunch.

As sweet breakfasts are Lucy’s favourite, this is one of the first recipes she had to adapt when she first became vegan. Here the banana is key to get that creamy texture you’d normally get from eggs in the classic recipe. Fear not, these pancakes are just as fluffy and delicious. Plus, they’re totally plant-based, of course.

Ingredients (serves 2):
-----------------------

*   2 ripe bananas
*   125g buckwheat flour
*   150g wholemeal plain flour
*   1 tsp baking powder
*   1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
*   1 tsp vanilla extract
*   2 tsp [Bulk Powders Zero Calorie Syrup](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/zero-calorie-syrup/bpf-zcsy) Maple flavour
*   180ml almond milk
*   2 tbsp [Bulk Powders Coconut Oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/organic-virgin-coconut-oil/bpf-ovco)
*   [Bulk Powders Chia Seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/chia-seeds/bpf-chia) for topping
*   20g blueberries
*   1 banana, sliced

Method:
-------

*   Peel the bananas and put them into a large bowl.
*   Mash the bananas with a fork until creamy.
*   Sift in the flour, baking powder and cinnamon.
*   Stir well to combine and whisk the milk until you have a thick and smooth batter.
*   Put 2 non-stick frying pans over medium heat.
*   Divide the coconut oil between the 2 pans.
*   Using a ladle, pour 3 ladlefuls of batter into each pan to make 3 pancakes.
*   Allow these to cook gently for 2-3 minutes on one side until they’re bubbling.
*   Flip them over and cook for a further 2-3 minutes until thick and fluffy.
*   Put 3 pancakes onto each serving plate.
*   Top them with the sliced banana, blueberries, chia seeds and syrup.
