Easter: one minute you’re watching BBC specials on the sofa, the next you’re surrounded by ten different chocolate eggs – and a bunny for good measure. Lucky for you, we’ve got five delicious treats to make with all your leftover eggs.

**A Cup**

Alright, hear us out… not the healthiest option, but definitely the most Instagrammable. To make the cup, dip a knife in boiling water and hold it against the top of the egg. Slowly slice around (dipping the knife to re-heat every so often) until the top comes off the egg. Voila! A chocolate cup.

Thanks to our very own [@\_emilysworld](https://www.instagram.com/_emilysworld/), we’ve even got the world’s greatest Salted Caramel Protein Shake recipe for you to fill the cup with.

_Emily’s Recipe_

Peanutty Chocolate Salted-Caramel Protein Shake of Dreams

**INGREDIENTS:**

300ml of coconut milk

150g of frozen banana

30g of [vegan chocolate protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-powder/vser-vppo)

5g of cacao powder

5g of [Maca powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/maca-powder/bpb-maca-0000)

10g of powdered peanut butter/ peanut flour

a pinch of pink Himalayan salt

15g of agave nectar/ syrup

LOTS OF ICE… the more ice the thicker the smoothie

**  
Chocolate Brownies**

Guaranteed to be a hit every time you bake them, these brownies pack a little protein punch thanks to the MACRO MUNCH chunks. Add pecans for a little extra fibre and protein.

_Brownie Recipe_

**INGREDIENTS:**

110g dark chocolate  
110g unsalted butter  
125g caster sugar  
175g light muscovado sugar  
150g plain flour  
A good pinch of salt  
2 eggs  
2 chopped MACRO MUNCH bars  
Handful of chopped pecans (optional)

1: Preheat the oven to 170ºC (gas mark 3) line a 20cm (8″) square shallow baking tin.

2: Put the chocolate and the butter into a bowl and melt gently over a pan of barely-simmering water.

3: Next, stir in the two sugars and the vanilla extract. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then mix in the flour, salt and chopped MACRO MUNCH bars. Don’t overdo the mixing – a brownie batter is better if it’s a little unevenly mixed.

4: Scrape into the prepared tin and bake in the centre of the oven for about 25-35 mins until set but not solid. Cool in the tin, then cut into squares.

**A Dip**

Simple, effective and oh-so indulgent: melt down your chocolate get in some fresh strawberries, marshmallows, biscuits – whatever you want! – and get dipping.

**Hot Chocolate**

Perfect for the chillier evenings, the humble hot chocolate will never lose its charm. Just grate a quarter of your Easter egg into a mug and pour over some hot-but-not-boiling milk. Add cream and marshmallows if you’re feeling particularly decadent.

**Chocolate Mousse**

Ideal for serving at your next dinner party, this delectable chocolate mousse comes with compliments guaranteed.

_Mousse Recipe_

**INGREDIENTS:**

6 egg whites

2 tbsp golden caster sugar

1 chocolate egg (melted)

Chopped Macro Munch for the top

1: Melt the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds so it doesn’t cook.

2: Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks.

3: Add the sugar and whisk again until the mixture forms stiff peaks.

4: Add a spoonful of chocolate to the egg whites and stir well. Then add the rest of the chocolate to the egg whites and fold until mixed.

5: Pour into glasses or ramekins.

6: Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

7: Place chunks of MACRO MUNCH on top to serve.
