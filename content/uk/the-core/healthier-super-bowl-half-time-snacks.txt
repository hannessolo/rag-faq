NFL fans will already know that the Super Bowl takes place on Sunday 3rd February. It’s the culmination of the National Football League season and it’s always about far more than the game. There’s the atmosphere, the rivalry, the half time performance… and the food.

Super Bowl food is not renowned for being light, low-cal, or high protein. But we’ve found a way to recreate your favourite Super Bowl half-time snacks so you can enjoy the game and still reach your fitness Endzone. Ready for kick off? Here’s what we’ll be snacking on when the half time whistle blows.

Swap takeaway chicken wings for homemade Active Seasonings™ chicken wings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our calorie-free, super tasty herb and spice blends will turn homemade chicken into hot and spicy bite-size morsels, with all the taste of traditional wings but much less fat! If you want to stay close to real thing, use chicken wings, or you could try cutting up chicken breasts into strips for an even lower calorie option. We like dipping the chicken in [Liquid Egg Whites](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/liquid-egg-whites/bpf-lew), then adding a coating of Active Seasonings™ (Jamaican Jerk or Smoke and Spice would work well). Then bake the meat in a hot oven (use spray oil on the baking tray first). Traditional Super Bowl chicken wings are high calorie, fatty, and pretty low protein when you consider how much meat is on each piece! Our version is high protein, low fat, and packed with taste from Active Seasonings™.

Swap beer cocktails for Complete BCAA Energy™
---------------------------------------------

Sure, it’s not the same as a beer cocktail but wouldn’t you rather watch the game with a clear head? [Complete BCAA Energy™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/instantised-bcaa/bpb-ibca-0000) mixes up into a refreshing drink which supports your muscle mass (thanks to the branch chain amino acids). But that’s not all – it also has caffeine, to keep you alert and partying after the final whistle.

Swap cupcakes for protein muffins
---------------------------------

Super Bowl day usually has plenty of cakes on offer, but that’s an easy way to derail your diet. Why not bake your own? Make your cupcakes lower fat, higher protein, and packed with healthy ingredients – win/win! We love our Chia Seed Muffin Mix which combines whey protein, egg protein, and milk protein and comes in two flavours (vanilla or chocolate).  Of course there’s nothing to say you can’t add mix ins (like Cacao Nibs, Cacao Buttons, or [Goji Berries](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dried-goji-berries/bpf-goji)), or making a [casein protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/micellar-casein/bpb-mpi9-0000) “frosting” to top your healthy protein muffins.

Swap shop-bought party mix for homemade with raw ingredients
------------------------------------------------------------

Party mix is so yummy… but that’s the problem. Once you start taking handfuls of that sweet and salty combination of ingredients, it’s hard to stop. If you’re going to have bowls of party mix out on Super Bowl day, accept that people won’t be able to stop snacking… so make it healthier. We love to combine raw nuts, seeds, dried fruit and berries, and our Cacao Buttons. You could even chop up a couple of [Protein Snack Bars](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/protein-bars) and mix them in. If that sounds like too much shopping, cut a corner by buying our ready-made [Fruit Nut and Seed Mix](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nuts-seeds) and tipping everything into a bowl. You’ll still need to exercise some self-restraint (nuts are high calorie), but a homemade party mix is a much healthier option than anything you can buy in the store.
