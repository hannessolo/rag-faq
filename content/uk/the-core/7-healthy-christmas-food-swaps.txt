Have a healthier festive period with these tasty food swaps!

Christmas might only be one day, but the feasting seems to start earlier and finish later every year. How can you navigate a month of celebrations without piling on the pounds?

You have 3 options:

1) YOLO the entire thing and deal with the consequences in January.

2) Track food, turn down treats, and miss out on a lot of the fun.

There is a third option, and it’s easier than you might think.

3) Switch up some of the festive foodie treats with smart swaps that slash calories but save the flavour!

It’s never been easier to make healthier choices at Christmas. Sure, you can still indulge in your very favourite things (and we think you should – this time of year is all about quality time and special memories).

But you no longer have to eat every fatty, sugary, calorie laden treat on offer. Here are 7 festive food swaps that could save you from going up a clothes size this December! (Bonus: you might actually prefer them to the traditional version anyway!).

1) Instead of sugary syrups…
----------------------------

Use [Zero Calorie Syrup™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/zero-calorie-syrup.html). Our incredible syrups are just like the real thing but without the tooth-tingling sensation of all that sugar. In fact, they are zero sugar, zero calories, and zero fat. There are 6 flavours, including maple syrup, butterscotch and vanilla. Ideal for ice-cream, fruit, or cake over Christmas. This swap will save a ton of sugar and calories!

2) Instead of salty seasonings….
--------------------------------

Use [Active Seasonings™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/active-seasonings.html). These amazing seasoning pots have no additives or preservatives, and no salt or sugar. They’re packed with herbs, spices, and fresh ingredients. Choose from 9 flavours including Garlic & Herb, Smoke & Spice, Peri Peri, Tandoori, and Lemon & Herb. Use them on cooked joints of meat or fish, cold meats, or all those random leftovers soups and curries you magic up between Christmas and New Year!

3) Instead of sugary festive coffees….
--------------------------------------

Use [LiquiFlav™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/liquiflav.html) drops. These nifty little bottles inject sweet flavour into hot drinks (as well as oats, yoghurt, and anything else you can think of!), but they don’t contain any sugar or fats. You could whip up your own version of those 500-cal coffee shop monstrosities – without the calories! Choose from 6 flavours including chocolate and vanilla. Then get creative!

4) Instead of snacking on chocolates…
-------------------------------------

Enjoy our [Chocolate Whey Balls™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chocolate-whey-balls.html). They look just like a very familiar round chocolate snack…. but they’re so much more nutritious. They come in dark, milk, or white chocolate versions which is more than can be said for those other ball-shaped crunchy chocolate snacks! Chocolate Whey Balls™ have a crunchy whey centre and premium chocolate coating, so they will give you 20g protein per 100g. You’ll still have to ration yourself, but why not get the protein hit (and avoid the excess sugar) whilst you enjoy a ball-shaped crunchy chocolate snack item…!

5) Instead of pastries for breakfast…
-------------------------------------

Why not offer to make everyone protein pancakes? Use our [Protein Pancake Mix](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein-pancake-mix.html) to make it as easy as can be. You can take the pouch with you if you’re the guest, or just have it at home if you’re the host. These protein pancakes come out soft and fluffy, just like American drop-style pancakes, but the nutrition content is so much healthier. The mix contains two types of protein powder, egg white powder, and ultra fine oats. You and your friends can top them with berries, [nut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters.html), syrup or whatever you want. Much healthier than regular pancakes or pastries!

6) Instead of rocky road snacks…
--------------------------------

Keep a pack of our [Chocolate Protein Bites™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chocolate-protein-bites.html) to hand. These delicious bite-size chocolate nuggets are sweet, tasty, and moreish… but so much healthier than any shop bought or even homemade chocolate snack at this time of year. They’re made with whey protein and premium chocolate, so you get all the taste but a fraction of the fats and sugars – plus the benefit of extra protein to help crush cravings. Choose from 3 flavour options.

7) Instead of that late night slice of cake…
--------------------------------------------

Make yourself a [Protein Mug Cake](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein-mug-cake-mix.html). This easy powdered mix creates soft, spongy little cakes in a mug which have 24g protein and just 2.5g sugar each. Much better for you than scouring the kitchen for one more mince pie or a midnight slice of Mum’s panettone.  The mix is made of whey, casein, milk protein and egg white powder with ultra fine oats, MCTs, and ModCARB™ supergrains, and both flavours taste absolutely incredible. Ideal when you feel the need for a cake little snack but want to steer clear of all the Christmas cakes.
