Peanut Butter is a fitness favourite, but what’s the truth about those healthy eating claims?

The gym life and [peanut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters/peanut.html) go hand-in-hand. Peanut butter is in every fitness Instagram feed, every meal plan, it even features strongly in fitness fans’ cheat meals.

It’s easy to see why: the stuff tastes amazing! It’s buttery, nutty, slightly salty, and oh-so-moreish. But what are the real health benefits of everybody’s favourite snack?

How To Choose A Healthy Peanut Butter
-------------------------------------

This is easy. Go as natural as you can. Look for peanut butter that contains peanuts… and that’s it. A little bit of salt is OK (but unnecessary). [Peanut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/peanut-butter-1kg.html) does not need added oil. And it definitely should not contain sugar, palm oil, preservatives, or any weird ingredients. Peanut butter – the clue is in the name.

What about those “high protein” peanut butters? We’ve got one or two of those in our product range, so obviously we think they have a place in a healthy diet. But again, avoid long ingredient lists and unnecessary extras. Our Nuts About Whey™ contains only peanuts, whey protein isolate, [organic virgin coconut oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html), flavouring, and sweeteners.  Take a good look at your peanut butter and be sure it’s as close to nature as can be.

What’s Good About Peanut Butter
-------------------------------

Apart from the taste, you mean? Peanut Butter is a real food that has been linked to a lot of health, fat loss,and muscle growth benefits.

It is high in calories, which can be a good thing if you eat it in appropriate amounts. Hard gainers, or anyone who wants to gain weight, can get the calories in without a load of food volume that can be tough to digest. And a small amount of peanut butter has the calories you need to support intense, high output training sessions.

When you need the calories, peanut butter is a great way to get the energy you need without excess food volume.

It is high in fibre, and low in carbs, so can actually support your fat loss goals (as long as you practice portion control!). If you fit peanut butter into your calorie allowance, and have your training and activity on track, peanut butter can be a very tasty, rewarding low calorie treat.

Natural peanut butter like ours is high in monounsaturated fats, which can be useful in controlling blood cholesterol (when eaten in place of saturated fats).

Plus of course, peanut butter is a fantastic all-rounder food. Just about the only people who can’t eat it is anyone who has a peanut allergy. It’s great for vegans, vegetarians, people with dairy intolerance, and people who can’t eat gluten.

Super Versatile Treat
---------------------

We won’t mind if you choose to eat your peanut butter straight off the spoon (we’ve all been there…) But if you want some more creative ideas, how about:

– adding peanut butter to your [protein shakes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein.html) or smoothies ([Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html), [oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html), and frozen fruit + peanut butter is our go-to recipe)

– spreading on rice cakes (the chocolate-topped ones if you want a really special treat)

– using it as a coating or marinade for chicken breasts or steak

– making a satay sauce with it

– mixing it with Greek yoghurt or quark as a dip or spread

– adding it to your hot oats (oats, Whey, [egg whites](https://www.bulk.com/uk/liquid-egg-whites.html), and peanut butter = awesome)
