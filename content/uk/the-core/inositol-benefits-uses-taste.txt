 **WHAT IS INOSITOL?**
----------------------

Inositol is a simple carbohydrate that occurs naturally in the plant world and in our own bodies. In powdered form – like our [100% Inositol Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/inositol/bpb-inos-0000) – is it a simple and cost-effective natural supplement that can help with a range of common challenges. These include dieting, weight loss, fat loss, anxiety (and other emotional issues) and insomnia. Additionally, inositol is closely linked with Choline, which helps support normal liver function.

You might hear inositol referred to as Vitamin B8, although this is a bit misleading. It’s not actually a member of the [B-Vitamin family](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/b-vitamin-complex-tablets/bpb-bvit-0000) at all. Which is why we prefer to call it inositol. Myo-inositol is the premium and only form we would recommend. 

You can get inositol from plant sources in your diet, including fruits. But – as with so many natural supplements – it’s difficult to get an effective amount from dietary sources alone to see any inositol benefits. This difficulty is exactly why we stock 100% Inositol Powder; it’s so easy to get a precise daily dose whenever you need it.

**INOSITOL BENEFITS & USES**
----------------------------

Inositol can be used to help ease a number of common issues; if you are having trouble losing weight, if you suffer with anxiety, or if you have problems sleeping then inositol powder could help.

### **INOSITOL & WEIGHT LOSS**

Myo-inositol can help you lose more weight on a calorie-controlled diet due to the positive effect it has on the body’s hormones. Some people report taking inositol powder when they hit a weight loss plateau, or when they seem to have put on weight despite doing everything right with diet and exercise. As well as helping to balance hormones involved in weight loss, appetite, and satiety, inositol may actually help you eat less. This is partly down to its potential impact on mood and emotional wellbeing. When you feel better, you have fewer cravings and make better food choices, right?

### **INOSITOL & PCOS**

PCOS is a disorder of the endocrine system (hormones) and metabolism, and is a difficult condition that can impact a woman’s ability to lose weight. There is evidence to suggest [inositol can help women suffering with PCOS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23336594), and can help some women by promoting healthier hormonal balance without drug intervention.

### **INOSITOL FOR SLEEP & INSOMNIA**

Sleep problems can have a huge impact on your weight loss goals, your training performance, and your all-round enjoyment of daily life. When you don’t sleep well, you can feel sluggish and overly emotional the next day. You’re more likely to crave carbohydrates and junk food, and it can even be more difficult to feel full from your meals. Inositol can actually help if you have insomnia caused by over-thinking or a racing mind at bedtime. If you feel like you can’t switch off, or lie there worrying, then give inositol powder a try. Inositol helps your body balance optimal levels of the hormone serotonin and the brain’s GABA receptors, both of which help you feel calm and restful.

Take inositol around 2 hours before bed, cut back on caffeine, and see if it helps.

### **CHOLINE INOSITOL ANXIETY**

The highest levels of inositol in the human body are found in the heart and brain. This is interesting news for people who suffer with anxiety and low mood. Inositol interacts with the brain’s neurotransmitters to boost the transportation of messages and signals. Not convinced? Take a look at the [research into inositol and anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9169302).

One of the big benefits of inositol for anxiety is that it’s not a drug, and has no reported side effects. It works on anxiety in much the same way as it helps with insomnia, by impacting serotonin and the GABA receptors. You may feel calmer, more peaceful, and might experience a gentle boost of mental energy.

Finally, if you drink a lot of coffee or ingest products containing caffeine, this can interfere with the inositol (plus high caffeine intake might not be great for anxiety or insomnia anyway) so cutting back on caffeine in order to take inositol could be a wise decision.

**WHAT DOES INOSITOL TASTE LIKE?**
----------------------------------

Inositol is a carbohydrate (it’s actually a sugar) and has a very mild sweet taste. Some people can’t taste anything at all. Inositol powder mixes well with water or other drinks and will add a very slight sweetness (although you might not taste it).

**INOSITOL DOSAGE**
-------------------

To enjoy the benefits of inositol powder, you should add 500mg to 50ml water and take it with food. You can take 1-3 of these servings throughout the day. Caffeine can have a negative impact so consider reducing your caffeine intake. Definitely don’t take inositol at the same time (or just after) any drink or supplement containing caffeine.
