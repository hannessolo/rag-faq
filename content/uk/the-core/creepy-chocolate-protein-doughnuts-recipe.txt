### Summary

Get your mitts on these Creepy Chocolate Protein Doughnuts! They pack some serious protein and will keep you fuelled whilst you’re out on the streets scaring your neighbours this Halloween.

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 165C

2.) Combine casein, [PURE WHEY PROTEIN](../../pure-whey-protein.html "Pure Whey Protein")™, coconut flour, cocoa powder and oat bran together in a bowl. Add in the egg, yoghurt, beetroot and [coconut oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "Coconut Oil") and mix/blend until smooth.

3.) Stir in the baking powder.

4.) Lightly oil your doughnut pan (don’t forget to oil the middle bit too!). Spoon in the batter. I got three, using 45g of the batter for each, plus a little bit of left over mix that I made a mini cake with.

4) Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and release from the tin, then cover with a tea towel until fully cooled. Ice and enjoy!

**‘Icing’:**

Simply mix together BULK POWDERS™ Raspberry Whey, a splash of almond milk and a spoon of Greek yoghurt until you get the right consistency! Leave in the fridge to thicken if you can before using.
