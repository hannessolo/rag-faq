Remember the excitement you used to feel visiting a sweet shop? The sugar-dusted drawers, the stripey bags and the honeyed aroma in the air. We’ve got that same feeling with this new collaboration, which combines some of our bestselling supplements with the nostalgic taste of childhood. It’s **Bulk™ × Barratt®**. Are you ready?

**Who are Barratt®?**
---------------------

An incredible 175 years old, Barratt® & Co. (as it was then called) was established in Hoxton, London in 1848 by George Osborne Barratt. By 1906, it was the largest confectionery manufacturer in the world. With famous flavours including Flumps®, Dip Dab®, Refreshers®, Fruit Salad® and BlackJack®, Barratt® has been filling up sweet shelves for generations.

Hitting the sweet spot between nutritional value and nostalgic taste, we’ve merged our expert formulas to create sweet-tasting, quality-driven supplements. Whether it’s the exotic pineapple and raspberry Fruit Salad, the bold aniseed BlackJack or the smooth vanilla marshmallow Flumps, this launch embodies the joy and colour of Barratt®’s legendary sweet flavours. Let’s take a closer look.

Flumps
------

Fluffy marshmallow cables with a vanilla twist. Super satisfying to bite into and incredibly moreish, the chummy vanilla and marshmallow flavour makes the perfect blend for a tasty whey protein.

**Flumps Pure Whey Protein**

**BlackJack**
-------------

First made in the 1920s, this aniseed flavour black chew is the closest you’ll get to the traditional licorice sweet. Over a century later, we’ve transferred this iconic flavour into a totally unique whey protein.

**Fruit Salad**
---------------

The flavour of this tropical raspberry and pineapple chew is unmistakable. With popping, colourful bursts, Fruit Salad provides the perfect base for a whey protein and BCAA supplement.

**Refreshers**
--------------

Fizzy and full of zingy flavour, each little disc will make your tongue tingle. The strong, tangy taste of Refreshers blends beautifully with our Pre-workout, Clear Whey Isolate and Clear Vegan Protein.

**Lime Refresher Pre-Workout, Clear Whey Isolate &** **Clear Vegan**

**Dip Dab**
-----------

A sachet full of lemony sherbet dust with a juicy strawberry lolly inside. Once tasted, the lollipop is traditionally dipped into the sherbet to create a wonderfully fizzy coating. We’ve made this special sweet into a tangy Clear Whey Isolate. A must try.
