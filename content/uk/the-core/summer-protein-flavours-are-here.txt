But not for long. We’re launching limited edition [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000) and [Vegan Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-powder/vser-vppo) flavours each day over the week in 5 iconic flavours of summer.

Close your eyes and be transported to a tropical island paradise with our delicious Exotic Iced Lolly flavour. A combination of exotic fruits with smooth and creamy vanilla that will tantalise your taste buds. Maybe you prefer the sound of a summertime classic like Blackcurrant Sorbet, refreshing and bursting with flavour it’s creamy with a zesty blackcurrant edge. We have also turned the ultimate indulgent summer dessert, Key Lime Pie, into one of our [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000) flavours. A sweet but zingy combination of limes, creamy vanilla and buttery biscuits. A citrus lover’s dream. Of course, Iced Latte made the cut. Made with real coffee, it’s an absolute must for those hot summer months.

We have a delicious summer option for our plant-powered protein lovers too – Peach & Mango. A fruity fusion of ripe peach and juicy mango. This winning combination is perfect for vegans and non-vegans alike for a refreshing smoothie any time of day.
