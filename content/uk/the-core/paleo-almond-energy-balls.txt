Legend has it she once fought off a Sabre-Toothed Tiger using only the power of her mind. Others believe she was the first person to ever fly on the back of a Pterodactyl – perhaps the only human (ever) to co-exist with the dinosaurs.

All we know is she is called **The Muscle Baker** and she loves to make a paleo treat. Try this **Paleo Almond Energy Balls** recipe for a quick snack – perfect if you’re on the move!  

### **Instructions:**

1.) Mix [**Almond Butter**](../../almond-butter.html), pumpkin puree, molasses and coconut sugar together until combined.

2.) Fold in [**Pea Protein**](../../super-pea-protein-isolate.html), you will find it will soak of moisture and your mixture will become easy to work with. (If not add a bit more pea protein.)

3.) We chose sesame seeds to coat but use whichever nuts/ seeds/ dried fruit etc. that you prefer, you could even coat them in more coconut sugar for a sweeter treat.

\*Replace with a granulated sweetener of choice if you do not have coconut sugar.

_Note: we used canned pumpkin puree but you can make your own by baking sliced quarters of pumpkin flesh-face down in a tray filled with water approx. 1inch high until flesh becomes soft._

Recipe yields 10 balls.
