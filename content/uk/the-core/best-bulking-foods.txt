Reps. Sets. Supersets. You can do all the work in the gym, but you won’t pack on serious muscle without focusing on your diet. You need to eat the right foods, and you need to eat a lot of them to maintain a calorie surplus.

Not sure where to start? 

Thankfully, there are plenty of options. It can be a quick snack, a light bite or the main part of your meal. 

Let’s run through the best bulking foods.

**Best foods for bulking**
--------------------------

**1\. Chicken**
---------------

Chicken and rice. Chicken and broccoli. Chicken and… pretty much anything. Chicken is the backbone of nearly every gym-goer’s diet, and for good reason.

Chicken breast typically contains around 54g protein and just 3.4g fat, which makes it a top choice for bulking and cutting.

Although the calorie count is low – around 165 calories per 100 grams – the massive protein content helps build healthy muscle. There’s a reason many bodybuilders eat it multiple times per day. 

**2\. Rice**
------------

Much like chicken, rice is the holy grail for dedicated trainers. It’s one of the best high carb foods for bulking, containing around 28g carbohydrates per 100g.

It’s also a high-GI carbohydrate and high in fibre – that means you can eat more of it without feeling full. Perfect if you’re looking to pile on the pounds.

**3\. Milk**
------------

Milk is one of the best bulking options. One glass contains around 150 calories and it provides a good source of protein, which combines with fats and carbs to help restore muscle glycogen stores. Put simply, it’s an easy way to maximise your chance of building muscle. 

For the best results, add it to your regular [protein shake](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein) after a workout or have it just before bed. See it as your evening protein treat.

**4\. Nuts**
------------

Whether you prefer them as a tasty snack or adding flavour to a meal, nuts are one of the best calorie-dense foods for bulking. They can contain 300 calories per 50g, provide high amounts of protein and are rich in fats. The calorie density and versatility makes nuts a go-to during bulking season.

Alongside the taste and calorie content, nuts have multiple health benefits. They’re bursting with essential micronutrients and minerals, such as zinc, magnesium and selenium.

Make nuts a staple of your diet and notice the difference it makes to your body.

**5\. Banana**
--------------

While we’re talking about GI, bananas are another example of a food with a low- medium GI. This means it’s more filling than other carbs, like pasta or white rice. 

However, it is also famed for its fast absorption, making it an exceptional post-workout option. 

One study also cites bananas as an [incredible source of energy for exercise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355124/), concluding that eating bananas before and during prolonged and intensive exercise is effective for supporting performance.

**6\. Avocado**
---------------

Packed with a stream of B and C vitamins, avocados are one of the prime healthy bulking foods. A fruit rich in monounsaturated fats, they add calories and [“good fats”](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/) to your diet.

As well as the health benefits, avocados are delicious and they go with anything. Add them to your salads, try them on your toast or pair them with eggs. 

There are many choices, and they all taste incredible.

**7\. Protein bars**
--------------------

You’ve got a hectic day at the office, you’ve not had time for a big food shop or you’re peckish after an intense workout – that’s where you need [protein bars.](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/protein-bars.html)

Packed with protein and easy to eat on-the-go, they’re a convenient, high-protein snack. They taste incredible too.

**8\. Tofu**
------------

Tofu isn’t just loved by vegans, it’s loved by anyone looking to bulk. Made with [soy protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/soya-protein-isolate-90/bpb-spi9-0000), the plant-based powerhouse packs in all nine essential amino acids, making it a crucial component for muscle recovery.

If you’re on a thorough training plan, top up with tofu. An incredible [vegan protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-powder/vser-vppo).

**7\. Eggs**
------------

Nature’s multivitamin and superfood, eggs are a must-have in your diet. They’re rich in protein, high in fat and provide around 75-90 calories per egg.

When you also consider the healthy cholesterol levels, they’re one of the best foods to eat when bulking. Plus, they taste great.

**8\. Potato**
--------------

When you think of bulking, your mind probably wanders to plates of meat and layers of fatty foods. But carbs are just as important, which is why potatoes are so important to a successful bulk.

A medium-sized potato contains around 37g carbohydrates, providing a steady source of sustained energy. Make them your go-to before a lengthy session in the gym or extended bouts of cardio.

They’re a great source of carbs to rotate with rice and pasta, ensuring your meals maintain a reasonable level of variation.

**9\. Protein pancakes**
------------------------

You love protein. You love pancakes. Why not combine the two? Similar to protein bars, [protein pancakes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/protein-pancake-mix/bble-chpp) are a tasty snack for between meals or when adding bulk to your breakfast.  

The light, fluffy pancakes offer a massive 26g protein per serving and can be combined with a variety of toppings. Mix and match until you find your favourite for the bulking season.

See to [how to make protein pancakes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/pancake-day/), see our blog for some tasty recipes and cooking advice. This includes a [blueberry protein pancake recipe](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/blueberry-protein-pancakes-recipe/).

**10\. Oats**
-------------

Continuing the theme of complex carbohydrates, [oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html) are one of the best high-carb foods for bulking. So rustle up some porridge in the morning. Get yourself some oatmeal in the afternoon. 

Making oats a regular part of your pre-workout routine adds more energy for your workouts. 

Alongside the energy boost, oats are full of fibre and contain a substantial amount of calories per serving. They’re an essential bulking food.

**11\. Salmon**
---------------

Rich in protein and high in omega-3 fatty acids, you’re recommended to have oily fish at least once per week.

When you’re smashing a workout every day, it’s worth upping your salmon intake to 2-3 times per week. Rustle some up with a hearty portion of rice or potato to reap the benefits. 

**12\. Pasta**
--------------

Tasty carbonara. Chicken with penne. Spaghetti bolognese. Pasta is an ideal bulking food because it seamlessly combines with other bulking foods. It’s the ultimate teammate in your bulking diet. 

But it’s more than just its versatility. 

Pasta packs in 70g carbohydrates and around 350 calories per 100g – perfect for a pre-workout surge and post-workout recovery.

**15\. Coconut oil**
--------------------

Adding coconut oil to your daily routine is an easy way to pack in extra calories and healthy fats. Just sprinkle the frying pan with a generous dose before each meal. Simple.

**16\. Beans**
--------------

High in protein, carbs, and fibre, beans are one of the best bulking foods. They’re also incredibly versatile. Have them on toast in the morning, with soup at lunch and in your chilli at dinner.

A cup full contains around 245 calories and 15g protein – a substantial step towards your daily goals.

**Best macros for bulking**
---------------------------

That’s all the best bulking foods, now let’s get down to the macros. The focal point for success. Master the macros – that means getting the [right macro split](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/how-to-decide-your-own-macro-split/) – and you’ll take control of your physique. 

Let’s take a look.

### **Best protein for bulking**

In terms of type of protein, there’s none that stands out especially. But for foods, you’d have to put chicken, soy and whey (found in milk) near the top.

Moreso than where it comes from, getting the [optimal amount of protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/how-much-protein-do-you-really-need/) is pivotal for bulking. If you have a daily intake of 3000 calories per day, around 25% of those calories should come from protein. 

Chicken, eggs and fish should form a large portion of your meals. Snack on protein bars and drink protein shakes to optimise your intake.

### **Carbs for bulking**

Carbs are going to form the bulk of your diet. Around half of the calories you consume should come from carbs, and some prefer even more to maximise their training output. 

Rice, oats, pasta and potato are everyday foods that supply a consistent stream of carbohydrates.

### **Fat for bulking**

Much like protein, fats should form around a quarter of your calories. Focus on getting good fats – such as from avocado and nuts – to boost your heart, cholesterol levels and overall health. 

**Best supplements for bulking**
--------------------------------

Any [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) or [vegan protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-powder/vser-vppo) is great option, but best is are [mass gainers](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/mass-gainers).

Mass Gainer contains over 500 quality calories per serving, including at least 65g of carbohydrate, 5g of leucine, and 43g of protein from slow and fast-release sources. All this helps you increase your protein intake and get you into a calorie surplus. Along with a diet enriched with the wholefoods above, this is an incredible tool for serious bulking. 

Even in summer and you’re sipping on fruit juice, replacing said juice with [Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-whey-isolate/bpb-cwhe) is an easy way to add more protein to your diet.

**The Final Word: Best Bulking foods**
--------------------------------------

Get your diet right and you’ve laid the foundations for building heavy muscle. That means getting the right food and the right amount.

Once you’ve conquered the kitchen, you’ll be ready to crush every workout.
