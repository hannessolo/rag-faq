After an exciting end to 2017, with leading athletes such as [Anthony Joshua](https://www.bulk.com/uk/anthony-joshua) joining [TEAM BULK](https://www.bulk.com/uk/teambulk), and a strong start to 2018, we’re really proud to announce we have won not one… not two… but three awards in the Men’s Fitness Sports Nutrition Awards 2018!

With product development at the heart of what we do here at BULK POWDERS®, it’s always fantastic to receive awards that highlight the quality of our products, and acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our skilled product team who work tirelessly to bring you the best flavours and formulations on the market.

We have received the Gold award for the “Best Whey Protein” for our [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html). Winning the top award in this category reflects the high quality, outstanding value, and fantastic variety of flavours (23 to be exact!) available.
