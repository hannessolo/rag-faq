In a year where we’ve launched almost 100 new products, we asked our product team to pick out their favourites. It proved a harder task than they imagined, but here is what they chose:

### Elliot chose **ELEVATE™**

![ELEVATE™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/elevate.jpg)

[ELEVATE**™**](../../elevate.html "ELEVATE") is my choice of new product launch for 2014, as I really feel it’s a class leading product. Formula wise, I’ve seen many pre-workouts with lots and lots of ingredients – some with a never ending list. However, I’ve never seen a pre-workout with the research proven dosages that ELEVATE™ contains across every single ingredient.

ELEVATE™ isn’t just stimulant heavy, the 13 different ingredients encompass focus, performance and muscle pumps. I’m particularly pleased it isn’t just me that thinks this as the customer feedback has been absolutely fantastic on both results and taste. ELEVATE™ has a full money back guarantee and suffice to say we’re not troubled with customer returns!

Training wise, I tend to train around 21:00-22:00 as I’m normally in the office until late evening. I’ve found ELEVATE™ really helps to motivate me at the end of a long day. I enjoy all of our pre-workout products, but ELEVATE™ has got that bit extra that makes it my product of the year.

**Some important product facts:**

*   Incredible 13 potently dosed, reseach-proven ingredients
*   Banned substance tested under Informed Sport programme
*   Includes Vitargo®, ActiNOS™ and BioPerine®

### Adam picked **Complete Protein Porridge™**

My favourite product launch of 2014 is [Complete Protein Porridge™](../../complete-protein-porridge.html "Complete Protein Porridge"). I tend to spend a majority of the time on the go, in and out of meetings, etc., and I’ve found that Complete Protein Porridge™ has really helped me to take on quality calories.  A couple of minutes in the microwave and I’ve a high quality, high protein meal that’s ready to go.

I’m also particularly pleased that BULK POWDERS™ are the first company to really espouse the benefits of heat stable whey protein. If a product is going in the microwave or having boiling water added, I think heat stable whey is a real plus point for the product. It’s an expensive ingredient, but well worth it I feel.

I normally have Complete Protein Porridge™ as a second breakfast (I’ve a fast metabolism) when I get into the office – Chocolate Raspberry flavour is my preference, it’s delicious! I’ll often have a second serving later in the day, particularly if my diary is full of meetings and convenience is a priority. I’ve definitely found that adding Complete Protein Porridge™ has made a positive difference to my overall nutrition, which makes it my product of the year.

**Some important product facts:**

*   22g protein per serving
*   High protein, low GI breakfast option
*   Heat stable – Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate

### Ali decided on **Complete Greens™**

When asked to do this, I struggled to choose between [Complete Greens™](../../complete-greens.html "Complete Greens") and Complete Fruits™. However, my favourite product launch of 2014 is going to be Complete Greens™. I am really keen on trying the latest superfood and using them in my homemade smoothies. I already use quite a few of BULK POWDERS™ superfood products, but Complete Greens™ is always a part of my daily supplement regime. It contains a lot of my favourite ‘greens’ already in a 24 ingredient formula, meaning I also consume some nutritious ingredients which I wouldn’t usually. It is also is a lot easier and efficient to consume than the amount of hydrated greens it would take to make up the same concentration.

I particularly like the 5-herb blend, as this is definitely a USP for Complete Greens™ and means you have an extra powerful antioxidant blend in amongst the rest. This along with the fact it is unflavoured (meaning you’re not drinking about 50% flavouring) makes it a genuinely healthy product for those who want a high quality concentrated greens powder.

Complete Greens™ for me is a quick and convenient way to consume my greens and get a more than adequate amount of vitamins and minerals, as well as extra benefits of antioxidants, essential fatty acids, fibre, and phytonutrients. It really does give me a natural energy boost and I also really enjoy the herby taste, which tastes great in a homemade soup!

**Some important product facts:**

*   Contains 24 nutrient dense super green foods
*   Equivalent to more than 5 of your 5 A DAY
*   Well dosed ingredients with high ORAC scores

### Rowan selected **CUTTING EDGE™**

![CUTTING EDGE™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cutting-edge.jpg)

[CUTTING EDGE™](../../cutting-edge.html "Cutting Edge") is my favourite product launch of 2014. Not only am I a fan of its exciting, innovative and comprehensive formula but I’ve had great results from it. I’ve used it across the year to help drop a bit of body fat and I’m really pleased with the results.

One of the main things I noticed was a reduction in appetite – this is an area I sometimes struggle with. The innovative formula combines a number of appetite suppression ingredients such as Glucomannan and Phenylalanine which makes for a really noticeable difference. Products I’ve used before seem to have been loaded with stimulants, but my hefty appetite stayed the same!

This product is also my favourite of the year due to the unique, comprehensive formula, which looked at research proven ingredients to provide [fat loss](../../weight-loss.html "Fat loss supplements") from a range of methods. This shows that the product really is “CUTTING EDGE” in its formulation, changing the way in which I supplement for fat loss in the future.

Not only am I a fan of the formula, but the packaging and presentation is also impressive; in particular the Pro Series™ branding on the box. In addition, the blister packs have made transporting this product really easy, especially as I divide my time between Colchester and London.

**Some important product facts:**

*   Our most effective fat loss supplement
*   Full money back guarantee
*   Contains 10 highly dosed & proven ingredients

### Si voted for **Omega Oil Blend™**

![Omega Oil Blend™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/omega.jpg)

Choosing a favourite new product launch for 2014 is a tough ask. After all, we’ve launched almost 100 products this year. Being forced to pick one, I’d go with [Omega Oil Blend™](../../omega-oil-blend.html "Omega Oil Blend").

Over the last 8 years I’ve typically competed in either Bodybuilding or Powerlifting competitions. As such, at various stages of the year, I’ve got to try and optimise my weight for a specific weight class. I find that the addition of Omega Oil Blend™ has really helped with this. When trying to lose weight, carbs typically drop and protein and fats are comparatively higher – Omega Oil Blend™ provides a convenient way of adding high quality fats to my diet. I typically use fish oils (such as [Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels 1000mg](../../shop-by-category/health-well-being/fish-oils/super-strength-omega-3-softgels.html "Omega 3 softgels")), but if I’m trying to bump essential fats right up, it’s difficult to beat the convenience of Omega Oil Blend™. If, on the other hand, I need to gain weight then carbs and protein will stay high and Omega Oil Blend™ helps to complement this with healthy fats.

Essential fat has an anti-inflammatory benefit; powerlifting training, as you’d expect, involves a lot of maximal or near maximal lifting and I feel that Omega Oil Blend™ makes a big difference.  Since launching Omega Oil Blend™ I’ve definitely increased my essential fat intake and that can only be a good thing.

**Some important product facts:**

*   Flaxseed, Sunflower, Hempseed & Evening Primrose Oil
*   Added Vitamin E to prevent oxidation
*   Great source of Omega 3 6 9 essential fats
