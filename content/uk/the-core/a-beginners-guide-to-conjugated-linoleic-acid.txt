[Conjugated Linoleic Acid](../../cla-conjugated-linoleic-acid-softgels.html), or CLA as it is also known, is an Omega-6 fatty acid, found predominantly in vegetable oils but also from food sources like beef and dairy, in smaller amounts. As our diet’s have evolved through the years, the levels of CLA consumed from the food we eat has declined.

CLA is primarily a weight loss management supplement, believed to increase metabolic rate and fat metabolism.

### **Why should I take CLA?  
**

[CLA](../../cla-conjugated-linoleic-acid-softgels.html) is well known for improving body composition due to its ability to divert calories from fat cells to the muscles. If fat loss is your primary goal, CLA, if used in conjunction with an exercise plan and a sensible diet, could be very effective. The interesting thing about CLA is that whilst it isn’t a miracle weight loss cure, it is believed to reduce the pattern of weight gain, which in the long-term can be very beneficial to health.

Supplementation of CLA has also been shown to deliver certain performance benefits too, such as improved strength output and increased muscle mass.

### **When should I take it?**

It’s generally best to take CLA before, or with food.

### **How much should I take?**

It’s recommended that you take 2 soft gels 1-3 times per day, ideally with food.

### What supplements work well with CLA?

If your primary goal is to improve body composition, supplements such as Caffeine, Super Strength Green Tea, or a formula like Complete Thermogenic™ are popular synergists with CLA supplementation.
