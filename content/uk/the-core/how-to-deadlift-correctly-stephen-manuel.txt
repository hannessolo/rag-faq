The deadlift technique can be a little tricky to perfect, especially for beginners. But you’ll gradually over time be able to lift more weight. But remember, safety first! Leave your ego at the door until you have the technique mastered.

When performing the deadlift, it’s important to try and achieve a flat back – believed to be the safest way to execute this lift.

It’s the lumber spine – the lower back, which needs to be focused on. This is where you end up getting a really sore back when you’ve been doing some horrible deadlifts. It’s not so much the thoracic spine as this is the vertebrate which keeps the ribs in place.

Footwear is also an important factor. It’s best to be as close to the bar as possible, so get rid of spongey or solid heels. Instead, use wrestling shoes, or do it in your socks. This means the movement becomes more efficient due to being closer to the bar. Extra inches on the heel simply add more distance the bar has to travel.

Your hamstrings need to be mobile. If you feel your hamstrings need to loosen, you may find a kicking exercise beneficial before you begin deadlifting.

Leave yourself an inch between your shins and the bar – don’t be set up with the bar too close. To get down to the bar, your knees will be forward and then stick the chest out by pulling the shoulder blades backwards and downwards. To help lock in your lumber spine, push your bum back.

Stephen prefers an alternated grip, as you’ll get to a point where you can’t hold much double overhand. The other hand pulls the bar a little closer to your body and helps cover more weight.

From this position, push the knees forward, upholding a nice tall chest, push the bum back, while trying to maintain the hips. Once you get to the top, squeeze and take it back down.
