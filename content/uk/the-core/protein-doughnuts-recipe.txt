### Summary:

Imagine a world where you can eat doughnuts and still balance your diet with healthy macros. Wouldn’t that be a magical place to live? The good news is, it exists! Introducing ‘the’ Protein Doughnut recipe. High in protein, slow-release carbs and fibre, these doughnuts are about to break the Internet…

### Instructions:

1) Preheat the oven to 170C.

2) In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Allow to sit for a minute or so, then blend together until smooth. Stir in any extras you like now.

3) Lightly oil a doughnut pan with melted coconut oil, or spray oil. Divide the batter between three donut holes. Bake for 12-14 minutes until done. Allow to cool slightly, before removing from the pan to cool fully. Enjoy!

These are really easy to customise – I made an apricot doughnut with a pistachio frosting, a plain one with cashew frosting and for one I put a scoop of [Complete Fruits](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-fruits/bble-cred "Complete Fruits")™ in the bottom of the doughnut pan before spooning in the batter for a tangy, fruity coating!

Nut butter frosting: mix together equal weights of your chosen nut butter and almond milk (ie. 10g cashew butter and 10ml milk) Salt and sweeten to taste. Cashew, peanut and pistachio are my favourite.
