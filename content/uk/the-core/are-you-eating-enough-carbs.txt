Low-carb, no-carb, [ketosis](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/ketosis/ "Ketosis")… We’re here to fly the flag for carbohydrates. Find out why active people need carbs (and when to eat what kind for maximum performance).

Carbs are having a hard time of it just now. Fats are sexy (butter is even headline news). But what of the humble spud, loyal grain and smart [carbohydrate supplement](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/carbohydrates "Carbohydrates") source?

Carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients (the others being fats and protein). Carbs carry a caloric load of 4 calories per 1 gram of carb. You can probably name a lot of carbohydrate foods off the top of your head: oats, rice, potatoes, fruit, sugar, bread. But vegetables, beans, pulses, legumes, and grains (not to mention sweets, cookies, cake, sugar and sugary drinks!) are also sources of carbohydrate. And carbs are in a lot more than just “carb foods”: nut butter, milk and cottage cheese for example all contain carbs.

Carbohydrate is a primary energy source for the human body
----------------------------------------------------------

The more active we are and the more muscle mass we carry, the more use we have for carbohydrate. In fact, trained individuals with a decent amount of muscle mass tend to be more efficient at using carbs for energy. The smarter we get at using carbs for performance and recovery, the better the body gets at putting them to good use.

Carbohydrates don’t just replenish energy and help us perform well in the gym. They play an important role in transporting amino acids and vital nutrients to muscle cells and organs. Carbs are needed most by endurance athletes and after training or racing, when glycogen levels are at their lowest.

So how, when and what should we be eating by way of carbs?
----------------------------------------------------------

It’s largely down to personal preference, carb tolerance levels, lifestyle and taste. Some people thrive on oats and protein every morning, and some prefer to backload their carbs, eating the majority of their carbohydrate macronutrient allowance after training and at night. Some folk will spread their carb allowance out during the day in equal amounts, whilst others will top and tail their workouts with carbs, eating them before and after (and often using an intra-workout drink containing carbs, too).

Most would agree that it’s important to take in carbs after training, to stimulate an insulin response. Insulin is a very important hormone for athletes, bodybuilders and anyone who trains for muscle gain, body recomposition, strength or power. It plays an important role in the transportation of vital nutrients including glucose, protein, creatine and amino acids to the muscle cells after training.

Whatever your approach, it’s good to know the best sources of carbohydrate for different stages of performance and recovery. Here’s our guide to high GI and low GI carbs.

### **High GI (rapid glycogen replenishment)  
**

**These choices are great for the post-workout window when you want to fast-track recovery.**

### Vitargo®

[Vitargo](../../vitargo.html "Vitargo")® is a patented sports performance carb which has been clinically proven to improve performance. It’s more expensive than some of the more popular high GI carb staples but here’s what you get for your money: faster absorption, quicker glycogen replenishment, and clinical studies to back up the performance claims. Find out more about why Vitargo® is a [Post Workout Colossus](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/vitargo-a-post-workout-colossus/ "Vitargo a post workout colossus").

### Dextrose

[Dextrose Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dextrose/bpb-dext-0000 "Dextrose Powder") is a very high glycemic index (GI) carbohydrate which is digested rapidly and stimulates a fast insulin response (insulin spike). It has a sweet taste and its affordability makes it a very popular carb choice.

### Maltodextrin

[Maltodextrin](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/maltodextrin/bpb-malt-0000 "Maltodextrin") is actually a sugar (polysaccharide). It is manufactured from starch and is made up of dextrose polymers of different lengths (but it doesn’t taste sweet). Whilst Maltodextrin is also a high GI carb source, when combined with other nutrients like protein and fats, the GI reduces significantly, meaning that nutrients are delivered to the muscles gradually, rather than all at once.

### **Low GI (sustained energy release)**

**Lower GI carbs are the better choice for times when you want a slower release of energy, helping manage blood sugar levels.**

### Aktivated® Barley

Aktivated® Barley is a super-food which is a slow release, low glycemic index (GI), carbohydrate source. It is rich in beta-glucan, fibre, highly bioavailable proteins, essential fats, enzymes and minerals. At a slow-release GI of 20-30, it’s a great carbohydrate source for athletes who need enough energy to train and perform to optimum levels at all times.

### Maca Powder

[Maca Powder](../../maca-powder.html "Maca Powder") is an ancient “super-food”, Maca Powder is ideal for anyone following a gluten free or low GI diet. It can be added to shakes, smoothies or even baking, and is a viable alternative to other carbohydrate sources. A great source of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and fibre. An added bonus, Maca is also believed to improve libido…

### Sweet Potato Powder

We all know how great sweet potatoes are ([the Daily Mail says so](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2998613/Are-hipsters-Craft-ales-Spotify-headphones-added-nation-s-shopping-basket-calculate-cost-living.html "Sweet Potato")), well now you can supplement with pure powdered sweet potato in your shakes, smoothies and healthy protein baking. This popular food based carbohydrate source is going down a storm!

Don’t be afraid of the carb; carbohydrates are your friend, especially when it comes to turbo-charging your workouts and recovery, but like anything in life, moderation is the key.
