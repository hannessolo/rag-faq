Last month I was given the chance to attend my first BodyPower expo with BULK POWDERS®. As well as being reunited with Team BULK POWDERS®, this gave me an opportunity to try some products I haven’t tried before, and that means that I’ve been counting down the days until this order so I can receive some exciting new products.

Here’s a sneak peek into my supplement order this month…

**[BCAA](https://www.bulk.com/uk/instantised-bcaa.html) | Mojito**

This is the closest I’ll get to an actual mojito (which I LOVE) until September, and if you use or want to use BCAAs I recommend this flavour with a bit of ice chucked into your shaker. Love it.

_When do I use this? I use BCAAs as an Intra-workout. BCAAs trigger protein synthesis – meaning they play an important role in muscle energy production during exercise._

**[Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html) | Birthday Cake**

I can’t believe I haven’t tried this until now. I’ve not tried this combo yet but I hear that this + oats/porridge is pretty much cake without the guilt. I went back for 5 or 6 samples of this flavour, can’t get enough! Chocolate Cookies is also another great one for sweet tooth cravings.

_When do I use this?_ _I personally use whey whenever I want! Post workout is the obvious choice, but if I want to add protein to my morning porridge (it’s important to get protein in the morning) or to a mid-day smoothie, I’ll do it._

**[ELEVATE™ ZERO](https://www.bulk.com/uk/elevate-zero.html) | Pineapple and Grapefruit**

[ELEVATE™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/elevate.html) is a favourite of mine anyway, I usually get Summer Berry, but this flavour is amazing. The Vitargo has been dropped from the recipe, so with this version of ELEVATE™ you’ll get lower levels of carbs and sugar. What’s not to love?

_When do I use this? I use this before some of my gym sessions (particularly at this time of year when we’re going for PBs at the top of a 4:2:1 weights pyramid). I’ve also sometimes used ELEVATE™ before my races, or even before my track sessions after a long day at work. I really do love this product._

[**PROM3GA™**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/prom3ga.html)

Couldn’t believe my eyes when this was released. Two of my priority supps are [Vitamin D3](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamin-d3-tablets-5000iu.html), and [Krill Oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/krill-oil-softgels.html). PROM3GA™ is a super strength fish oil and Vit D3 all in one. Hit the nail on the head with that one, BULK POWDERS® – good job.

_When do I use this? Every day._

[**Dark Chocolate Almond Butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/dark-chocolate-almond-butter.html)

If you haven’t tried this, you are missing out. Equally if you haven’t tried this then at least you will be able to resist it. I could have stayed on the nut butter stand all day for this product. Do you love chocolate? Do you love [nut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters.html)? Of course you do. Get this on your wishlist immediately.

_When do I use this? Do you really need to ask…_
