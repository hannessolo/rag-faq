Confused about which supplements to take? We hear you. As part of Wellness Week at **Bulk™**, we’re giving you the lowdown on which supplements might be best suited to your needs. Whether you’re looking to enhance your training and recovery, support aspects of your diet or improve your sleep, we’re here to help. 

**What is a dietary supplement?**
---------------------------------

A dietary supplement is a product that includes ingredients such as vitamins, minerals, botanicals, amino acids and enzymes. Dietary supplements are sold in forms such as tablets, capsules and powders.

Supplements are intended to support a healthy diet, not replace it. This could be for a number of reasons, such as convenience, short-term deficiencies, specific diets or a busy lifestyle. Let’s explore this in more detail. 

**Enhance training and recovery**
---------------------------------

As leaders in sports and active nutrition, we continuously strive to create the highest quality products possible, offering a range of supplements designed to enhance your training and recovery. If you’re serious about your schedule, or you want to take your training to the next level, this section is for you. 

### **Beta Alanine (Pre-workout)**

Taken before your heavenly bout of exercise, [**pre-workout supplements**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/pre-workout) can help prepare you for an intense workout or training period, with the aim of improved performance during your session. Typical pre-workout mixes include caffeine, a natural stimulant, but there are many variations. [**Beta Alanine**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/beta-alanine/bpb-bala-0000), for example, is a naturally occurring, non-essential amino acid that’s a popular pre-workout supplement. It can enhance exercise performance by increasing muscle carnosine content.

### **Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin (Intra-workout)**

As the name suggests, intra-workout supplements are designed to use during your workout, such as between sets, breaks or even while running. Adding something like [**Highly Branched Cyclic Dextrin**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/cluster-dextrin/bpb-cdex-0000) to your sessions could be a game changer for supporting your strength goals. Cyclic dextrin is produced using a unique enzyme process that breaks down starches into a unique cluster structure. Essentially, this creates a superior carbohydrate that is easier for your body to absorb, meaning that its sharp hit works quickly to impact your session in a positive way. 

### **Protein Powder (Post-Workout)**

Of course, [**protein powder**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein) has made the list. An obvious, but essential, contender. Although regular protein intake (any time of day) is the most important factor in muscle growth and maintenance, post-workout protein intake can positively influence the recovery processes for both resistance training and endurance exercise. Whether it’s Pure Whey Protein™, Vegan Protein Powder or Clear Whey Isolate, just make sure you’re getting enough to really make the most out of your training sessions.

### **Creatine**

A conversation on enhancing training and recovery wouldn’t be complete without mentioning creatine. Famously the ‘world’s most researched supplement’, the potential benefits of creatine are vast and well documented. See our [**guide to creatine**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/beginners-guide-to-creatine/) blog for a clear explanation on how creatine works and whether it could support you.

**Support your immune system**
------------------------------

### **Vitamin D**

Supporting your immune system will naturally help towards your training goals. There are a range of [**vitamins**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamins) designed to support specific needs, and a multivitamin is a great option if you’re not sure which route to take.

One of the most important vitamins for immune support, along with [**vitamin C**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitamin-c-tablets-1000mg/bpb-vitc-t000), is vitamin D. Summer is a great time to naturally stock up your supplies, as your body produces it in response to sunlight (making sure you take care out there). As we approach the summer months, now’s your time, although we can’t rely too much on the British climate. Our [**Vitamin** **D3 Tablets**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamin-d3-tablets.html) are a high-strength form of vitamin D, promoting normal bone health and contributing to the maintenance of healthy immune function, as well as playing a role in cell division. Our ambassador [**Georgia Grant**](https://www.instagram.com/ggrantyfitness/?hl=en) takes Vitamin D every morning.

**Help maintain healthy joints**
--------------------------------

### **Fish oils**

It’s commonly understood that taking omega 3 rich [**fish oils**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/omega-3-fish-oil-softgels/bpb-omg3-0000) can support joints. One of our customer reviews reports noticing “the difference in my joint flexibility”. Fish oils are an excellent source of EPA and DHA, two essential fatty acids that aren’t synthesised by the body. Fish oil supplementation is perhaps something you hear about, but haven’t tried. Intense exercise can put pressure on the joints, so it could be worth considering if you’re serious about your training.

**Support a vegetarian/vegan diet**
-----------------------------------

If you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, it’s important to make sure you’re getting enough vitamins and minerals. As we discussed in [**5 Tips On How To Go Vegetarian**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/5-tips-on-how-to-go-vegetarian/), your body will feel it when something is lacking. All the nutrients you need can be found in your diet, but if there are certain vegetables you don’t like, you could be depriving your body of essential nutrients. B vitamins, iron and omega 3 may be specific supplements to keep an eye on. And you can’t go wrong with an all-round supplement, such as our [**Complete Multivitamin Complex™**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-multivitamin-complex/bble-cmvc)**.** 

**Relax and wind down**
-----------------------

### **Ashwagandha**

Also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry, [**Ashwagandha**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ashwagandha-capsules/bpb-ks66-0500) is a herb derived from the roots of organically grown Withania somnifera plants. The adaptogenic properties can help maintain mental balance and support relaxation, supporting your mental and physical wellbeing.

### **CBD Oil**

You may not be aware that we have CBD oil amongst our product range. CBD oil is taken from Cannabis sativa leaves. It’s become increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative remedy for numerous ailments. Our **CBD Oil Dropper** is a simple easy way to integrate CBD into your daily nutrition. We must emphasise that it’s completely legal, safe and batch tested. It’s also a favourite with our ambassador [**Alex Dick-Cleland**](https://www.instagram.com/alexfitcleland/#).

**Help with restful sleep**
---------------------------

### **ZMA**

The fast-paced Western world can be stressful. When we want to slow down and sleep, it can be hard to switch off. If this sounds familiar, our **[ZMA® Capsules](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/zma-capsules/bpb-zma-0000)** might be just what you need. They contain zinc and magnesium, and studies have shown that these minerals may improve sleep quality.

Here’s what a happy customer said about our ZMA® Capsules, “I don’t know if it’s just a perception thing, but I seem to get a really good night’s sleep after taking these before bed. I’m a light sleeper, but I’ve noticed that these seem to give me a much deeper and more restful sleep than I usually get”.

**Summary**
-----------

With literally thousands of supplements available to you, the buzz and the noise around which ones to take creates a blurring sense of confusion, often resulting in us never scratching the surface of supplementation potential. And that’s normal. We hope, however, that this article opens a few doors and inspires you to discover new supplements that could light up your existing lifestyle, whether it be through better training, more restful relaxation or the simple pleasure of feeling good.
