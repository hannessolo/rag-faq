The Muscle Baker has worked her magic again, this time it’s a sweet vegan flapjack treat. This is one to share – if you don’t eat them all first!

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1) Preheat oven to 170 Degrees C.

2) Pour water and agave together in a saucepan (or bowl if doing in microwave). Whisk in VitaFiber™ and heat up (or in two 30 second intervals in microwave). Keep whisking on medium heat until VitaFiber™ has dissolved.

3) Fold in peanut butter and coconut oil, then sugar or sweetener, followed lastly by oats.

4) Line a deep baking tray and pour mixture in. Bake for approximately 15-20 minutes until oats start to golden but bake is soft to touch. You may even want to leave less time and have a softer bake.

Perfect for anyone looking to get some easy (but tasty) carbs in. You can also modify to suit by using different [nut butters](../../foods/nut-butters.html) or adding further ingredients.
