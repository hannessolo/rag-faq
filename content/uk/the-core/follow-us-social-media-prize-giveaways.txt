Social media isn’t just about posting up our latest offers. Sometimes we like to post stupid Vine videos that make us laugh. Or news stories about heroic athletes. But we also like to do [competitions](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/news-and-updates/competitions/ "BULK POWDERS™ competitions") and prize giveaways – everyone loves **FREE STUFF**.

### How to win free stuff

Every month we run lots of giveaways on Facebook and Twitter. You can also sometimes participate via Instagram. To keep things interesting, we like to mix it up by using different formats. These include…

– Simply typing in your name and email address via our Woobox platform (and then sharing for bonus entries!)  
– Guessing how many products are in a picture – closest answer wins  
– On Twitter, retweeting our tweets & following – each RT receives an entry (as long as you’re following us too)  
– Tagging your mates in the comments of the giveaway status post  
– Photo competitions where we pick our favourite entry  
– Caption competitions where we pick our favourite caption  
– Asking you to come up with your best poems about BULK POWDERS™ on National Poetry Day

### Recent giveaways and winners

Over [Halloween](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/pump-king-halloween-pumpkin-competition/ "Are you the pump king?") we did a competition brilliantly (if we do say so ourselves…) called ‘Are you the pump king?’

We wanted to see your best pumpkin carvings with the design ideally related to BULK POWDERS™ or health and fitness in general. Adam our winner carved the BULK POWDERS™ logo into his pumpkin and picked up £20 in points as the prize. What a legend! £20 of free supplements right there.

Recently on Twitter we have done a few RT & FOLLOW giveaways where every person who retweets our tweet and follows us enters into the draw to win free product. We’ve given away 1kg of [Complete Protein Coffee™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/collagen-coffee.html "Protein Coffee") and a BULK POWDERS™ [Premium Hoodie](../../premium-hoodie.html "Gym Hoodie") over the last couple of weeks. So make sure you’re following us to be in with a chance of winning!

We asked you to say which you wanted and to tag 3 friends. Or on Twitter, just RT & Follow. That was it. Entry received. Six winners were randomly selected and each were delighted to receive their delicious 500g tubs of Chocolate Nut Butter.
