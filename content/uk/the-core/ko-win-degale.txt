BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale successfully defended his WBC Title on Saturday night, with an 11th round stoppage of previously unbeaten Gevorg Khatchikian. DeGale twice dropped Khatchikian in the 11th round with body shots. Both times Khatchikian bravely beat the count but, after the 2nd knock down, the referee had seen enough and waved off the fight.

Going into this fight, DeGale knew that a win was essential to ensure that he went on to fight Badou Jack in a final eliminator for a shot at the current WBC champion Sakio Bika. In an interesting turn of events, Jack was knocked out in the first round of his fight on Friday night. DeGale has seen Marco Antonio Periban pull out of a final eliminator with him after terms had been agreed, and now Badou Jack has been knocked out in a warm up fight. Mentally, seeing your supposed next opponent lose in that fashion isn’t ideal as it creates some uncertainty as to what is next. Still, there was a job to be done and DeGale was fully focussed.

Khatchikian came into the fight having won all twenty of his previous contests. While the opposition hadn’t been of the same level as DeGale, Khatchikian was a proud, unbeaten fighter. DeGale was notably more aggressive than in previous fights, consistently coming forward and working to the body of Khatchikian. The constant pressure took its toll on Khatchikian, and he slowed notably in the later rounds.

In the 11th round, the accumulation of body shots from DeGale proved too much for Khatchikian and hooks to the body twice dropped him to the canvas. After the 2nd knock down, it was clear that Khatchikian would only have taken further punishment had the fight continued, and the referee stopped the contest. After the fight, DeGale sportingly raised his opponents arm and beckoned the crowd to acknowledge the bravery shown.

For DeGale, it was a successful return to the ring having been in a hospital bed 8 weeks ago after a groin operation. To go from hospital bed to successfully defending his WBC Silver Title in 8 weeks deserves a lot of credit. DeGale said, “This is the first fight I’ve been injury free for a long time, and I feel great. Sure, 8 weeks after an operation isn’t long enough to be on top form but I needed to fight to keep the momentum going.” Speaking on his recovery, James said “I believe the BULK POWDERS™ products helped me recover faster.” James’ nutritionist, BULK POWDERS™ Product Director Simon Jurkiw, said, “Products such as [Informed Whey™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/informed-whey.html "Informed Whey") and [Super Strength Fish Oils](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-category/health-well-being/fish-oils/super-strength-omega-3-softgels.html "Super Strength Omega 3 Softgels") would have played a role in the recovery process; specifically, aiding repair and reducing inflammation.”

DeGale has successfully defended his WBC Silver Title 3 times and through no fault of his own has seen two final eliminators fall through – it would seem the only option is for DeGale to progress to fight the champion Sakio Bika for the prestigious WBC Super Middleweight title in his next fight. The WBC board of governors are due to meet to decide what James’ next fight will be. James is desperate to get the Bika fight, as he **attempts to make history** and become the first British boxer to win an Olympic Gold medal and a world title.
