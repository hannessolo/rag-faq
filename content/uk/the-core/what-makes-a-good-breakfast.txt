It can be quite surprising to discover just how many people regularly skip breakfast. In January 2017, a survey run by The Express newspaper revealed that a staggering 50% of Britons claim that they do not have time to eat breakfast in the morning. \[[1](http://express.co.uk/life-style/food/754711/Breakfast-skipping-Britain-meal-health)\]

For many people, breakfast just isn’t considered a necessary meal, and this often goes against the enduring advice consistently emphasised by health professionals: breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

Though, the reality is that some people just prefer to skip it, either due to time constraints or simply personal preferences. While a healthy breakfast does have many positives, it doesn’t always impact how good of a day you will have in terms of to day-to-day performance.

For the breakfast lovers, and the curious breakfast dodgers, we have compiled a handy guide to breakfast time, including ideas, recipes, and inspiration!

**WHAT MAKES A GOOD BREAKFAST?**
--------------------------------

It’s a known fact that eating a balanced breakfast can help prepare and energise you for the day ahead. If you’re aiming to consume a high-quality breakfast, it should ideally contain the following components:

**1) Carbohydrates**

Your [carbohydrates](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/carbohydrates) should ideally come from complex, or slow-release, sources. This allows for a slower release of energy over an extended period of time to help keep you fuelled during the morning and into the afternoon.

Try to resist opting for fast-release carbohydrate options too often, such as sugary pastries and cereals, which may cause a short energy spike followed by a crash, resulting in tiredness and fatigue later on. For example, opting for a bowl of porridge oats with fruit will be a typically healthier option than a bowl of cereal.

**2) Fibre**

Fibre is a key component of a healthy diet, helping to not only keep you fuller for longer but also keep your digestive system running smoothly. Fresh fruit, oats, and whole grains would be good options for high fibre sources, as well as incorporating foods like flaxseed and chia seeds to really give your fibre intake a boost.

**3) Protein**

It would be a good idea to incorporate protein into your morning breakfast routine. Protein is key for muscle growth and recovery, and it also helps keep you fuller for longer, so it would no doubt get you off to a good start. Foods like eggs, plain Greek yogurt, and [protein shakes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein) are very popular options, as well as adding protein powder to smoothies or porridge to boost the protein content. You may even consider our [collagen coffee](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/collagen-coffee/bpf-pcof) to sip alongside your breakfast.

There’s also [Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-whey-isolate/bpb-cwhe) – a juicy and fruit-filled alternative to creamy shakes. Ideal for fruit-based smoothies.

3 HEALTHY BREAKFAST RECIPES

If you have some time to prepare breakfast in the mornings, here are 3 healthy and simple recipes that incorporate protein, carbohydrates, and fibre:

### 1) Eggs & Avocado Toast

**Ingredients**

*   1/2 avocado
*   x2 eggs
*   x1-2 Seeded slices of bread
*   Salt & pepper

**Method**

Mash up your avocado in a bowl with some salt and pepper. Cook your eggs however you like them (fried is best for that runny yolk!), and pop your bread in the toaster. Simply spread your avocado on your toast and lay your eggs on top. Feel free to add extra seasonings if you want to spice it up, like chilli flakes.

### 2) Overnight Oats

**Ingredients**

*   Rolled oats
*   Milk or an alternative of your choice
*   1 banana
*   1 tsp honey or maple syrup
*   1 tbsp nut butter
*   Sprinkle of cinnamon
*   Extra toppings of your choice (fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.)

**Method**

Pour your ideal portion of oats into a bowl or Tupperware (we recommend 50g for a small portion), and top with 100 ml of your choice of liquid. Chop in the banana and add in your honey, cinnamon, nut butter, and any other toppings you would like to add. Feel free to add more liquid if it becomes too stodgy. Give it all a good mix and leave in the fridge overnight, ready to enjoy in the morning.

### 3) Green Breakfast Bowl

**Ingredients**

*   50g spinach
*   1 avocado
*   1 ripe mango
*   1 apple
