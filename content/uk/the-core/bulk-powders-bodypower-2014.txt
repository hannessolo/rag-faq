Our BodyPower experience
------------------------

BULK POWDERS™ exhibited at BodyPower Expo for the first time this year between May 16th – 18th at the NEC Arena in Birmingham. We arrived on the Thursday at 5pm to finalise setting up the stand and stock, ready in anticipation for VIP entrants at 9am on the Friday. Six hours later at 11pm, exhausted from transporting around 50 x 20-30kg boxes through the hall to the stand, we were ready to pack up, head back to the hotel and get some sleep in preparation for the first day.

The stand looked fantastic – pure, clean, modern and stylish. It certainly stood out from the fairly corporate looking stands within the rest of the hall promoting bodybuilder ambassadors. The custom built design (thanks UIS!) allowed for a long ‘bar area’ stretching all the way round the stand. This allowed attendees to feel at ease approaching us, trying samples and chatting about their experiences using BULK POWDERS™ products.

The three day event was a huge success. We met so many existing customers plus plenty of new ones who were aware of us but hadn’t dipped their toes in the water. Feedback on the samples was extremely pleasing and many of you took advantage of the discounted show prices. Where else can you buy 2.5kg of the highest quality whey protein for £25?

[Collagen Coffee™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/collagen-coffee.html "Collagen Coffee™") proved the most popular product – innovative and tasty – it attracted a lot of interest. On the [ELEVATE™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/elevate.html "ELEVATE™ Pre-workout") sampling station, so many people couldn’t believe it was a pre-workout as the taste was more like a fruit juice for both flavours.

Social media was in full flow across the three days. The Wifi access was restricted inside the NEC but we managed to keep you updated via Twitter, Facebook and Instagram with text updates and photos. As mentioned before the show, anyone who turned up wearing a BULK POWDERS™ t-shirt got a free blender. We were also delighted to hand out the passes to our Facebook giveaway winners who told us they thoroughly enjoyed their time.

What we sampled
---------------

Across BodyPower we sampled – **Cola and Mixed Berry Instant BCAA, Chocolate Praline and Strawberries & Cream High Protein Snack Bars, Blueberry Complete High Protein Smoothie™, Double Chocolate INFORMED WHEY™, Chocolate Peanut Pure Whey Protein™, Black and White Complete Protein Coffee™ and Orange & Mango and Summer Berries ELEVATE™**.

Other products available to buy included Biltong, Peanut Butter, Liquid Egg Whites and INFORMED MASS™. Leaflets were displayed around the stand offering 20% off future orders and computer screens were set up for touch screen entry into our BodyPower prize draw for the chance to win up to £200 of supplements!

Every BULK POWDERS™ team member in attendance was on hand to answer questions and offer advice. Rather than have people on the stand who know little about the products – we took pride in the fact every person was a member of staff and had detailed product knowledge.

On Saturday evening after working 9am – 7pm we even managed to fit in a training session at Dorian Yates’ Temple Gym. Rich Piana was also there. If you ever go to Temple Gym in Birmingham city centre, look behind the counter for some BULK POWDERS graffiti!

Thank you!

We’d like to thank everyone who came to our stand, bought our products, took away leaflets, tried our samples and left feedback. We’ve taken many lessons away from the event which we’ll look to implement if we exhibit next year. One of which might be to get a removal firm to carry all our boxes!
