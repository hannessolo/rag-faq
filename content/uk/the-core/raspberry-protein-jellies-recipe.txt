Here’s a super-imple two-ingredient recipe for Raspberry Protein Jellies with some seriously good macros too! Even the most kitchen illiterate amongst us will be able to pull off this one off. Give it a go!

### Protein Jelly Instructions

1) In a measuring jug, make jelly as per instructions on packet, but instead of making up to 1 pint with one sachet. Make ¾ pint with both sachets.

2) Then, whisk in the 3 scoops of whey and pour into the fanciest mould you have. Alternatively, if you don’t have a mould, leave it set in your jug!

3)) We have made so many flavour alternatives for this, orange flavour jelly with Choc Orange Whey, lemon flavour jelly with Lemon Meringue Whey… You can even add fruit pieces if you’re feeling crazy! Sliced bananas actually work beautifully!

4) Leave set in fridge for several hours, then proceed to enjoy them! It’ll be hard to just eat one, but they are so great on macros you wont have to worry too much!
