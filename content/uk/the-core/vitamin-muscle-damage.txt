The benefits of Vitamin D are gaining some notoriety – more people are aware than Vitamin D deficiency is common and of the critical role Vitamin D plays in bone health. However, Vitamin D has a whole host of benefits.

A recent study on Rats found that Vitamin D may reduce muscle damage and inflammation. Rats were subjected to high intensity exercise and Vitamin D supplementation was found to reduce markers of muscle tissue damage as well as markers of inflammation. An abstract of the study can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466613001373). Key markers that were reduced in the Vitamin D supplementation group included Creatine Kinase and Interleukin-6.

The role of Vitamin D in muscle function is already known, but this recent research is an interesting insight into a potential role Vitamin D may play in reducing exercise induced muscle damage.
