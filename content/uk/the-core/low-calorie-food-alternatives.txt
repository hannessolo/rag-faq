To lose weight you will need to be in a calorie deficit. There are a number of ways to reduce the calories you consume on a daily basis, and it does not necessarily require drastic action.

In this article we will be taking a look at some low calorie alternatives you can introduce into your diet.

**Pasta/Rice/Noodles**
----------------------

If you’re trying to keep carbohydrate intake low, the chances are your plate looks a little empty with just some protein and vegetables on it. The good news is, you do not have to completely say goodbye to the things you love! Try out some of the following options.

### **Diet Pasta**

[Diet Pasta](https://www.bulk.com/uk/diet-pasta.html) contains just 6 calories per serving, as well as packing in over 3g of fibre and 0g of fat. The main ingredient of diet pasta is Glucomannan, which is derived from the Konjac plant. This water soluble fibre source has the ability to make you feel fuller, which can be a great way to stop you snacking on unhealthy options. So next time you are making a pasta dish, swap regular pasta for Diet Pasta to reduce the overall calorie content of your meal.

### **Diet Rice**

If you’re on an energy restricted diet and need something to satisfy your carb cravings, opt for [Diet Rice](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/diet-rice/bpf-dric). 100g of Diet Rice contains just 6 calories, as well as 3g of fibre. Next time you have a rice dish consider swapping regular rice for diet rice as a fantastic low calorie, and low carbohydrate alternative.

### **Diet Noodles**

Completely neglecting carbohydrates could lead to you feeling hungry even after eating your meal, meaning you may be tempted to turn to unhealthy snacks. [Diet Noodles](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/diet-noodles/bpf-dnoo) are a versatile product that can be added to soups or a stir fry, and will help to make you feel full. With a 100g serving containing no fat, only 0.5g of carbohydrates and 4.5g of fibre, Diet Noodles are certainly a great low calorie alternative to regular noodles.

**Active Seasonings™**
----------------------

Sauces, flavourings and dressings may be a problem when dieting as they can majorly increase the calorie content of a healthy meal. Preparing and consuming bland foods when dieting will only mean you’ll eventually get bored and feel the need to turn to unhealthier alternatives. [Active Seasonings™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/active-seasonings.html) are a great way to add flavour to your meals without adding the unwanted calories. With no additives or preservatives, which often come in the form of salt and sugar, Active Seasonings™ are an ideal choice for anyone interested in health and well-being, or for those who are looking to obtain a great physique. There are a number of great tasting flavours such as Cajun Spice, Jamaican Jerk and Peri Peri to suit whatever meal you’re preparing.

**Zero Calorie Syrup™ & LiquiFlav™**
------------------------------------

For those with a sweeter tooth, [Zero Calorie Syrup™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/zero-calorie-syrup/bpf-zcsy) works as a great alternative to maple or golden syrup. Zero Calorie Syrup™ comes in a variety of mouth-watering flavours, ready for you to add to porridge, pancakes, or yogurt, completely guilt free.

If you want to inject some more flavour into your food, [LiquiFlav™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/liquiflav/bp-liqu-50ml) are perfect to add to unflavoured shakes while being under 1 calorie per serving.

**Simple Swaps Can Bring Positive Results**
-------------------------------------------

Here you have some simple swaps that won’t dramatically change your diet or lifestyle, but should reduce your overall calorie intake and help support you with your weight loss goals.
