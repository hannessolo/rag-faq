National Fitness Day 2021 will take place on Wednesday 22nd September and is a chance to highlight the role physical activity plays across the UK, helping us raise awareness of its importance in helping us lead healthier lifestyles through being physically active. It’s a chance to recognise and raise awareness of how important physical activity is for our body, mind and wellbeing. It’s been a tough year, but exercise has brought us together. In those dark lockdown days, we ran through our parks and our streets, joined in online fitness classes, and sourced home workout equipment in our thousands. For some of us, it was a substitute for our usual training routines. For others, it was our first discovery of how keeping fit and active can improve our lives. 

This year we are celebrating National Fitness Day by bringing you a full body workout from team Bulk fitness guru and PT Alex Crockford. It’s a convenient workout that you can do from home, in the gym or even outside, with an even split of aerobics and strength, to get your whole body working. Not only that – we are also launching a brand new, deliciously refreshing flavour of our iconic [Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-whey-isolate/bpb-cwhe) protein powder. Get ready for Strawberry & Watermelon, a fruity and light way to get your protein fix, perfect post-workout, pre-workout or even as a snack between meals. Clear Whey Isolate is the answer for anyone seeking a high-protein, low sugar shake, without the milky taste and texture.

It’s amazing to move your body and get involved in training but don’t forget – recovery is just as important as working out. Refuel after training with our range of [post-workout heroes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/post-workout). We recommend our brand new [Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-whey-isolate/bpb-cwhe), as well as  [Pure Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000), [Essential Amino Acids](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/essential-amino-acids/bpb-eaa-0000) and of course the ultimate in protein snacking with our [Macro Munch Protein Bars](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-bar-V2/mmun-pbar-v2).
