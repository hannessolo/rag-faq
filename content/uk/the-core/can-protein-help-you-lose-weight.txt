**Protein Powder and Weight Loss**
==================================

Surely, you’ve heard this one before: a high protein diet for weight loss will get you the results you want. Wouldn’t it be great if it were so straightforward? In this quick guide, we’ll show you how protein could help you lose weight, the right way.

**Does protein help with weight loss?** 
----------------------------------------

The quick answer is no, not directly, there’s no specific protein powder for weight loss. The most important factor for weight loss is burning more calories than you consume. However, there’s a link and learning how to use protein powder for weight loss consists of optimising your nutrition to get the physical results you’re after. Let’s take a look at protein’s role more in-depth to get a better understanding of what it can do for weight loss.

### **The thermic effect of consuming protein**

Things will get a bit sciency for a second. When we talk about the thermic effect of food, we’re referring to the energy the body needs to digest and process the food we eat. This process is also known as Specific Dynamic Action and it’s usually looked at in relation to the number of calories that digesting a specific type of food requires. This calorie expenditure goes on top of the normal amount of calories our body consumes to perform the most basic as well as most complex activities when we’re at rest.

So how many calories does consuming protein burn? Foods with a high-protein content such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts and seeds, need more energy for complete digestion. Research shows they can increase your metabolic rate by 15-30%. On average, this means that if you eat 100 kcals from a high-protein source, you’ll be using 20-30 of those kcals to digest and absorb all of it.

### **Protein as an energy source**

Protein shakes, of course, are an easy way of adding protein to your diet. They’re quicker to prepare than a steak and they’re the go-to source for protein after workouts. 

If you’re thinking of using whey protein for weight loss, the two don’t necessarily go hand in hand. Whey protein is the gold standard for protein powders and it has many nutritional benefits that can support an active lifestyle. However, looking for the best protein powder for weight loss isn’t the most important factor. You should focus on the quality of nutrients you consume as well as the quality of your workouts and recovery time. Getting that combination right will get you closer to the results you want.

### **The satiating effect of consuming protein** 

Another factor that may lead people to believe that protein intake and weight loss are closely related, is the perception of higher satiety after consuming protein. However, this is very much a matter of personal perception, not an exact science. Generally, people feel fuller after consuming protein than carbs or fats. Of course, once that level of satisfaction is reached, you’ll be less likely to eat more – especially things that aren’t so great for weight management.

### **Cravings and supplements** 

If you’re committed to weight loss, you’ll be most likely going on a calorie-restricted diet. However, that doesn’t mean you should give up on your favourite tasty treats or introduce healthy alternatives that are just as good. In fact, you may even get to boost your protein intake and enjoy flavoursome snacks all at the same time.

For example, protein pancake mixes are ideal to get your protein and satisfy sweet cravings. Same goes for brownie and cookie mixes as well as nutritious snack bars. 

### **Protein preserves muscle mass**

As the main building block for muscle, protein is key to preserve muscle mass and protein supplements contribute to its maintenance and development. That’s especially relevant if your body goes through intense physical activity such as weight training. That’s when your muscle fibres will go under strain the most and that’s what will make them develop further. Thanks to protein, the muscle can recover from the stress of working out and increase in mass.

**How Much Protein Do You Need?**
---------------------------------

To know exactly how much protein you should be consuming, you’ll have to do a bit of math. Protein intake depends on your body weight and activity level. The recommended ratio is generally between 1.6 and 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram. 

**How Protein Powders Help**
----------------------------

Now that we know there’s no specific protein for weight loss, it’s worth focusing on its benefits. As mentioned before, it’s super quick to whip up a protein shake. Protein powder’s main perk is that it’s almost immediately accessible and requires no cooking Not all protein powders are created the same way. It’s always good practice to read the ingredients list and have a look at where the protein at hand comes from. 

On that note, there are protein powders, such as [Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/protein-isolates-compared/) that contain less sugar, for example, and could be considered as ‘lean’ for that reason. There are also protein powders available which contain ingredients that can directly help with weight loss. For example, both [Cutting Edge Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/cutting-edge-protein-compared/) and Complete Diet Protein Advanced contain Glucomannan, which contributes to weight loss when used in the context of an energy-restricted diet. Whatever formula you end up choosing, make sure that you’re entirely familiar with its content.
