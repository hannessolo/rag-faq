Whether you’re a keto dieter or you want to find an alternative to butter and other vegetable oils, MCT oil could easily be the replacement you’re looking for. Here, we’ll take a look at its benefits, uses and ideal diet partners.

What is MCT Oil?
----------------

If you’ve been on a nutrition journey for some time now, you’re probably familiar with the number of acronyms out there. Just in case this is a first, MCT stands for medium-chain triglyceride. It refers to the length of chained fatty acids that make up the oil and the number of carbon atoms they feature – usually between 6 and 12. As a form of fat in our body, they can be used to provide energy throughout the day.

Often, triglycerides get a bad rep. That’s because there’s a relationship between high levels of triglycerides and increased cholesterol levels creating a fertile ground for heart disease. However, they’re not all that terrible and in reality, we usually look at MCTs as [healthy fats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/why-are-healthy-fats-good-for-us/).

MCT Oil Benefits
----------------

One of the key benefits of MCT oil is directly linked to those chain lengths we just mentioned. Free of long-chain fatty acids and lauric acid we usually find in olive, palm and coconut oil and dairy fat, MCT oil is quickly utilised. It’s also believed to rapidly release energy – the shorter the chain, the faster the digestion.

How to Use MCT Oil
------------------

Most of these formulas are clear, odourless and unflavoured, giving you extra freedom and flexibility for use. Usually, MCT oil is a great addition to coffee, post-workout shakes and smoothies. Plus, it can be taken before or after working out.

### MCT Oil in Coffee

Think about it, you wake up feeling sluggish and you’re looking for that extra boost to start the day right. Adding it to your morning coffee is a great way to kickstart your metabolism from the get-go. You may feel a stronger sense of satiety and get an extra source of energy to spend.

Non-coffee drinkers, there are plenty of options for you, too. You can add the oil to your favourite [smoothie recipes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/bulk-eats-complete-greens-smoothie-recipe/) or use it as a salad dressing – remember, you won’t taste a thing!

### How to Use MCT Oil in a Keto Diet

This product can be especially relevant and interesting for keto dieters. That’s because it plays a central role in ketone production – the process that releases energy stored as fatty acids.

For those who aren’t familiar with the ins and outs of keto dieting, a quick explanation is in order. The [keto diet](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-keto-shake/bble-cket) is low in carbs, high in fat and claims to help you use fat as a predominant source of energy. With a high-fat/low-carb diet, you reduce the impact of food on insulin response. Therefore, there’s a lower chance for the energy to go directly into storage. Plus, you allow any fat that’s currently stored within fat cells to be released and used as energy (if you’re running on a calorie deficit).

With almost no carbs around, your body will start looking for other sources of energy. As carbs reserves progressively run dry, ketones will become the energetic alternative. It’s exactly this process that MCT oil can support.
