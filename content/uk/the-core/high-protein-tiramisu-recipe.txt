A recipe of epic proportions that the mysterious Beltsander (Instagram â€“ the\_beltsander) likes to consume post workout. When we posted this beauty on Facebook, it nearly broke the internet.

If you smash a deadlift PB, reward yourself with a slice of High Protein Tiramisu (or half if you have a big appetite). It takes just 5 minutes to make.

3.) Build layers of sponge fingers, mixture and grated 70% chocolate  
4.) Dust with cocoa powder
