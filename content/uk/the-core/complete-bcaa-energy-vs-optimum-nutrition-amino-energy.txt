Complete BCAA Energy™ is one of our innovative BCAA products which provides a clean source of energy from natural sources of [caffeine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/caffeine-tablets/bpb-caff-t000 "Caffeine"). We wanted to take an opportunity to compare this to a similar, popular product on the market – Optimum Nutrition™ Amino Energy.

### Complete BCAA Energy™ presents the list of ingredients explicitly

As you can see from the table above the formulas are similar, but differ in a number of ways. The defining difference is the way in which the ingredients are presented. Complete BCAA Energy™ presents the list of ingredients explicitly, showing the dose of each ingredient in the formula.

Amino Energy on the other hand, presents the information in blends (Amino Blend and Energy Blend). The nutritional information only displays dose information of the entire blend, not each ingredient within. Optimum Nutrition™ hides behind proprietary blends, and subsequently doesn’t share the definitive dosage of each ingredient.

### Amino Energy is not clearly broken down

Amino Energy provides a long list of ingredients within its Amino Blend. The Amino Blend consists of a range of Micronized Essential Amino Acids, alongside CarnoSyn® Beta-Alanine. When you immediately read the list of ingredients it looks impressive, however when you turn your attention to the doses of these ingredients, the information is not explicit. 12 ingredients are combined within a 5g dose; that equates to less than 0.5g per ingredient within the Amino Blend!!\*.

Research proven dosages of certain ingredients within the Amino Blend (e.g. BCAAs) equate to 5g, let alone the entire Amino Blend. In addition, the Energy Blend is not clearly broken down to properly list the inclusion of Green Tea Extract and [Green Coffee Extract](../../green-coffee-extract-50.html "Green Tea Extract").

### Complete BCAA Energy™ provides research proven dosages

In contrast, Complete BCAA Energy™ provides research proven dosages of BCAA (5g) in a Leucine heavy ratio (3:1:1), alongside 3g of [Glutamine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/search?sort=relevance&sortDirection=desc&q=glutamine "Glutamine"). In addition, Complete BCAA Energy™ breaks down all ingredients into their dosages, including those providing a source of energy; Guarana 400mg, Green Coffee Extract 100mg. This is a higher dosed formulation when compared to the Energy Blend within Amino Energy (160mg).

### Better product. Fraction of the cost.

Comparing Complete BCAA Energy™ to Optimum Nutrition™ Amino Energy highlights the differences between the products, and demonstrates that **Complete BCAA Energy™ is a far superior product**.

Complete BCAA Energy™ provides a more potent dose of amino acids and energy providing ingredients.

So if you use Amino Energy, why not make the switch to Complete BCAA Energy™, and get a better product for a fraction of the price?

\* Assuming an even spread across ingredients.
