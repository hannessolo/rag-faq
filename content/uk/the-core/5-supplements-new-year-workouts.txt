Who hasn’t started a New Year with a resolution is to get physically fitter and lead a healthier lifestyle? You only have to set foot in a gym during the first week of January and to notice how busy it is. Without the support to fuel your body for success, it can be difficult to keep these healthy habits throughout the year. 

Training is extremely important, but following a healthy, balanced diet is perhaps even more important if you want to see real, long term results. Alongside following a healthy diet, fitness supplements can be a great way to help kick start your New Year’s resolutions and maintain them throughout January and beyond. If you’re asking yourself, what supplements should I take? Look no further.

**#1 WHEY PROTEIN**
-------------------

If you want to build muscle, protein is very important. According to the NHS, adults should eat 0.75g of protein per kilogram of body-weight1. However, if you are exercising and weight training regularly, you should increase the amount of protein you eat, to help aid muscle recovery and growth.

If your aim is to build muscle, you should be looking to eat around 1.4g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. It can be difficult to meet your protein intake goals from food alone, and this is where [protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein.html) can be the perfect addition to your diet.

We sell a wide range of different types of protein, so it can be difficult to choose which one to use. If you are new to protein powder then [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html) could be for you. It provides over 24g of protein per serving, and is available in a number of great flavours, so you can find the perfect one. We also have vegan, and dairy free protein powder options available.

**#2 CREATINE**
---------------

Creatine is one of the most researched supplements on the market. It has been proven to help increase muscle size, as well as increasing overall strength and energy levels. It is an ideal supplement for anyone performing exercises which involve short bursts of high intensity activity, such as weight lifting or sprinting.

[Creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine.html) is a great supplement to take either pre or post workout, and can be easily mixed into your protein shake or taken on its own. To achieve the benefits of supplementing with creatine, we recommend taking 5g a day, after a loading week of taking 20g a day.

[Creatine Monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/creatine-monohydrate.html) is a highly popular and quality form of creatine. Our Creatine Monohydrate is 99.9% pure and has been tried and tested to ensure optimum effectiveness. 

**#3 BCAAS**
------------

Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are the essential building blocks of muscle. BCAAs help the body maintain muscle mass by preventing a process known as catabolism. This is when the body breaks down muscle to use as energy. You can supplement with [BCAAs](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids/bcaa) pre, intra or post workout, or even just sip them throughout the day.

[BCAA powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/instantised-bcaa/bpb-ibca-0000) contains the three essential amino acids – Leucine, Isoleucine and Valine – in a 2:1:1 ratio.

**#4 PRE WORKOUT**
------------------

Sticking to your New Year’s resolution is going to take commitment. This means coming up with a schedule and then doing your utmost to stick to it. There will inevitably be days when your energy levels are low and you do not feel like working out. It is moments like these when a [pre workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/pre-workout) can become a fantastic addition to your supplement stack.

Pre workouts are often high in caffeine to provide a short burst of energy, ideal for high intensity workouts. [Complete Pre-Workout™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/pre-workout) contains 200mg of caffeine per 24g to make sure you enter the gym ready for your training.

**#5 CASEIN**
-------------

If you are weight training regularly, you will be breaking down muscle fibres. Protein contributes to muscle growth and repair. When you sleep, you go for a number of hours without eating anything. This can lead to the breakdown of muscle, over a long period of time, as your body still requires energy for normal bodily function, even when you are asleep.

By supplementing with casein, you can provide your body with a slow releasing protein source, whilst your body is fasted. Our [Micellar Casein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/micellar-casein/bpb-mpi9-0000) contains 27g of protein per serving and less than 1g of fat.

**SMASH YOUR NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTION**
------------------------------------

The fitness supplements above will all help support your training and in turn help you to not just kick start, but also maintain and [dominate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/) your New Year’s resolutions! Make sure you are using these supplements as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Good luck!
