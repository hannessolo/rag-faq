[Weight loss](https://www.bulk.com/uk/weight-loss "Weight Loss Supplements") is one of the most popular goals of those participating in regular sports and exercise. Weight loss can be a massive challenge due to the calorie restriction leading to increased hunger cravings, increased appetite and decreased satiety after each meal. Therefore we have provided a top 6 list of the supplements (in no particular order) that will help to suppress appetite and increase satiety.

Appetite Suppressant Supplements
--------------------------------

### CUTTING EDGE™

[CUTTING EDGE™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/cutting-edge/bpps-cedg "CUTTING EDGE™") is our premium fat loss product that aims to stimulate fat loss through a number of different mechanisms. One of its mechanisms for inducing fat loss is to promote appetite suppression and increased satiety. CUTTING EDGE™ combines a number of ingredients that are all proven to suppress appetite such as Glucomannan, L-Phenylalanine, Caffeine and Cinnamon Extract. This synergistic effect of appetite suppression helps to prevent cravings and excessive eating whilst dieting to further enhance fat loss.

### GLUCOMANNAN

[Glucomannan](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/glucomannan-konjac-powder/bpb-gman-0000 "Glucomannan™") is one of the best supplements, designed specifically to increase satiety and decrease appetite. Glucomannan is a water soluble fibre from the Konjac plant which absorbs water and swells in the stomach. This swelling action helps to make you feel full and more satisfied, preventing you from eating unnecessary snacks and excessive food throughout the day, therefore decreasing overall calorie intake.

### PSYLLIUM HUSKS POWDER

[Psyllium Husks Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/psyllium-husks-powder/bpb-phus-0000 "Psyllium Husks Powder") is a rich source of fibre which will help to slow down the movement of food through the digestive system and increase the bulk of each meal. It is also low in calories (3.8 kcal per serving) and therefore does not add a large amount to your daily calorific intake. Adding fibre to shakes, meals and foods will increase the sensation of fullness you get from that meal, decreasing your appetite and therefore the likelihood of snacking later in the day.

### CAFFEINE POWDER AND TABLETS

[Caffeine](../../catalogsearch/result/?q=caffeine "Caffeine supplements") has been linked to a reduction in appetite, especially when taken at multiple points throughout the day. The appetite suppressing effect along with its stimulatory properties makes Caffeine an effective fat loss supplement.

### TYROSINE / PHENYLALANINE

Tyrosine and Phenylalanine help to stimulate the release of Dopamine and Norepinephrine which has a negative impact on appetite. It is believed that the increase in endorphin levels reduce cravings for sugar and carbohydrate rich foods. In addition Tyrosine / Phenylalanine have positive effects on mood, helping to keep you in a positive mind set when on a reduced calorie diet. BULK™ N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine won a Men’s Health Award (2014) for the ‘Boss Your Workplace’ category.

### COMPLETE DIET PROTEIN™ ADVANCED

[Complete Diet Protein™ ADVANCED](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-diet-protein-advanced/bble-cdpa "Complete Diet Protein™ ADVANCED") is our ‘diet protein shake’ which makes fantastic use of Glucomannan. The Glucomannan in combination with protein helps to increase sensations of fullness to help stop you snacking on unhealthy, calorific foods in between meals.
