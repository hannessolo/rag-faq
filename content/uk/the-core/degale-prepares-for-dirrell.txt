While the attention of the sporting world starts turning to the much anticipated clash between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale is deep in training for his IBF Super-Middleweight world title clash in Boston, USA, with talented American, Andre Dirrell on the 23rd May. DeGale Vs Dirrell headlines the card, which will be shown live on Sky Sports as well as being broadcast across the USA on the NBC network.

### Mayweather to be victorious

James, who has previously spent time training out in Mayweather’s Vegas gym, is picking Floyd to come out victorious. James exclusively told BULK POWDERS™, “Floyd is an amazing boxer – it’s not just that, having seen him train, the hard work and dedication he puts in is something for any upcoming boxer to aim for.” Contrary to some reports in the media, James hasn’t sparred with Mayweather – James is a lot bigger than Lil’ Floyd – it just wouldn’t have been fair on Floyd!

### Hard work and dedication is a mantra

For James, hard work and dedication is a mantra he’s adopted for a long time now. The last couple of months have been no different: “training has been tough. I push myself harder and harder every training camp and this fight is no different. In fact, the motivation of winning the world title makes the hard work and dedication all the more worthwhile.”

### “To my mind, me and Dirrell are the 2 best active Super-Middleweights right now.”

Shortly, James’ camp will move to America for the final stages of preparation. James said, “I’m doing this properly. I’m getting myself over to the States in good time to ensure I’m fully used to the time difference come fight night.” Asked about Dirrell, James responded, “yeah, he’s an excellent fighter. That’s what I want though – I don’t want to win the world title against an opponent people consider poor. To my mind, me and Dirrell are the 2 best active Super-Middleweights right now.”

BULK POWDERS™ Product Director, Simon Jurkiw, will be flying out to Boston during fight week to ensure James’ final nutritional and hydration strategies are as they should be. Asked about the challenge of fighting abroad, Simon stated, “Not to play it down, but for James it’s not a problem. He’s used to fighting all over the world and it won’t phase him. He’ll be there in plenty of time to get used to the time difference. In May, the climate in Boston is fairly similar to London (maybe a few degrees warmer), so there are no concerns whatsoever.”

BULK POWDERS™ will be with James every step of the way on his journey to becoming world champion, and the first boxer to win an Olympic gold medal for Britain and a professional world title.
