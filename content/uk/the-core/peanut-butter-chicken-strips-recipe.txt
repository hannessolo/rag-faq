We know it can be tempting to eat spoonfuls of peanut butter straight from the tub, but why not get creative with it? This recipe uses Peanut Butter and Peanut Flour to make Crusted Peanut Butter Chicken Strips. Enjoy!

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.) Preheat the oven to 220C. Prepare a baking sheet by lining with lightly oiled foil.

2.) Toast the peanut flour in a frying pan until turning lightly golden and smells nutty. Get three dishes to hand. In one, put the toasted peanut flour and 1/4 tsp of the salt. In the second, whisk together the egg, tamari and peanut butter, and in the third, mix together the pea protein, paprika and remaining 1/4 tsp salt.

3.) Coat each mini fillet in the pea protein mix first, followed by the egg mix and finally coat in the toasted peanut flour. Place on the prepared baking sheet and roll the coated mini fillet with the palm of your hand to ensure the peanut flour has stuck. Repeat until all the mini fillets are used up.

4.) Bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until lightly browned.
