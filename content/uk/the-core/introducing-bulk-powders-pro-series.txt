For our [Pro Series™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/pro-series.html "Bulk Powders Pro Series™") we went right back to basics. We asked ourselves what we would need to create the absolute best ingredients and optimal dosages. We simply wanted to set the benchmark and create genuine world class products. A big claim. And one we are proud to stand by.

With BULK POWDERS™ new Pro Series™, we truly believe we’ve created the best products on the market today. No expense has been spared with the formulations. If the research suggests Ingredient X needs 3g for it to work, then 3g is what goes in the formula.

As with our Complete Series™, we wouldn’t insult you by sprinkling a few milligrams of ingredients when it’s nowhere near the effective dose. A quick scan of the ingredient declarations shows that not only do the formulas have an impressive array of proven ingredients, but the dosing is far higher than in many competitors products.

Two of our Pro Series™ products, our premium whey protein ([INFORMED WHEY™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/informed-whey.html "Bulk Powders INFORMED WHEY™")) and our highly dosed pre-workout ([ELEVATE™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/elevate.html "Bulk Powders ELEVATE™")), are part of the **Informed Sport programme**. This means that every batch has been banned substance tested for athlete’s reassurance.

The Pro Series™ products come in premium packaging, with a **zip-lock and scoop** for your convenience.

We’ve also worked hard on the taste of each product to ensure that you get the absolute best formulas with the same fantastic taste that you’ve come to expect from the entire BULK POWDERS™ range.

Our first three Pro Series™ products are:
-----------------------------------------

### INFORMED WHEY™

With an impressive 81% protein content, INFORMED WHEY™ contains a mTOR Whey Complex™ with Pure Whey Isolate™ 90 as the main protein source as well as 5g Leucine. Additional Glutamine Peptides, DigeZyme® and LactoSpore® complete the formula. The added reassurance of the Informed Sport programme, makes INFORMED WHEY™ not only the best formula, but also the best value banned substance tested protein on the market.

### INFORMED MASS™

The premium theme continues with the Pro Series™ weight-gainer. Containing the same mTOR Whey Complex™ as INFORMED WHEY™, Ultra-Fine Scottish Oats as the carbohydrate source and Flaxseed Powder & Medium Chain Triglycerides contributing healthy fats, [INFORMED MASS™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/pro-series/informed-mass.html "Bulk Powders INFORMED MASS™") has an excellent nutritional profile. On top of this, HMB, Glutamine Peptides, Creatine Monohydrate, DigeZyme® and LactoSpore® have been added. It’s rare to see a weight gainer with such an impressive profile.

### ELEVATE™

Pre-workouts have had some negative press of late, due to contaminants or mislabelling. ELEVATE™ is part of the Informed Sport programme, so there are no such concerns. The outstanding formula contains 13 active ingredients, all of which are dosed at industry leading levels. There is no need for double servings; for many pre-workouts, it’s almost ‘standard’ that you need a double serving. Each single serving of ELEVATE™ contains 4g AAKG, 3.2g Beta Alanine, 3g Citrulline Malate and 2.5g TMG alongside 9 other exciting ingredients that focus on performance, pump and focus.

We’re so confident in our Pro Series™ that we are pleased to offer a **full product guarantee**. If you are not happy with a Pro Series™ product, we will refund you for the product in full. You must return the product to our specified returns address within 28 days, and you will be refunded in reward points.

We look forward to your feedback!
