These nutritious berries also contain high levels of vitamins and minerals to help with everything from inflammation to energy levels, to cholesterol control. Therefore Goji Berries can support your standard of general health and well-being. These benefits have resulted in many referring to Goji Berries as a ‘super food.’

The benefits of [Goji Berries](https://www.bulk.com/uk/dried-goji-berries.html) were highlighted by a study looking at the effects of Goji Berries on influenza.
