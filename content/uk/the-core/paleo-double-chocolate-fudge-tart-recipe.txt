### Summary

Here’s another primal treat to help keep the fires burning. Made with no fewer than 5 BULK POWDERS™ ingredients, including Chocolate [HydroBEEF™ protein](../../beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef.html) and one of our new nut butter flavours, Dark Chocolate Hazelnut, this is a Paleo Double Chocolate Fudge Tart to be approached with caution.

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 180C.

2.) In a mini food processor, add the hazelnut butter and dry ingredients for the tart case. Blitz to combine. Add the agave, egg and milk and blitz to combine to a gravelly consistency. It should be a little sticky, and hold together. Oil an individual tart tin. Press the crust mixture down into it. I used a piece of cling film to help press it in. Prick the pastry case with a fork. Bake for about 8 minutes, checking half way through. If it puffs up, don’t worry, just press it back down and leave to finish baking.

3.) Remove and lower the oven temperate to 150C.

4.) Now make the filling. Combine all the filling ingredients together in a bowl and blend together until smooth. Scrape about 2/3 of the mixture into the tart shell. Top with roasted hazelnuts, if desired and pop in the oven to bake for 35 minutes.

5.) With the remaining filling, simply pop into a ramekin and bake separately now or at a later date for a crustless gooey dessert!

**Tip:** If you haven’t got time, or fancy a crustless, completely guilt free, fudgy chocolate dessert, just skip the crust! Make the filling as directed, but fully line a 15cm cake tin or scrape into a small ovenproof dish and bake at 170C for 25 minutes.
