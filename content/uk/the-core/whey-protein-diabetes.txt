Diabetes is a condition that affects the way the body manages blood sugar. This often means that sugary foods cannot be metabolised properly, causing a spike in blood sugar levels. This is linked to an insulin resistance which prevents blood glucose from being removed from the bloodstream properly and left unmanaged, is dangerous.

It is common for people with diabetes to ask about the use of protein supplements and the potential impact they might have on their health – specifically how a protein shake may affect their blood sugar. We looked at some research around protein powder for diabetics and found some interesting results.

### **RESEARCH**

There has been some interesting research undertaken to identify the effect of whey on blood glucose and insulin response for people with Type 2 Diabetes.

Protein consumption is known to stimulate the production of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut hormone that in turn stimulates insulin production. Researchers hypothesised that stimulating GLP-1 production by consuming whey before a meal would therefore improve the body’s blood sugar control following a meal.

The study itself looked at 15 people with well-controlled type 2 diabetes who were on basic medication at the time. Participants consumed, on two separate days, whey protein or placebo followed by a high GI breakfast with sugar-containing jelly, to create maximum post-meal glucose spike.

### **RESULTS**

Results indicated that glucose levels were reduced by 28% when whey protein was taken before eating. Insulin and C-peptide responses were both significantly higher too (by 105% and 43% respectively) in the whey protein group vs. the placebo.

Consumption of whey protein shortly before a high GI meal may help to increase early and post-meal insulin secretion. This improved GLP-1 responses and reduced post-meal blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients. If you or someone you know is looking for a protein shake suitable for diabetics, why not try one of our [Pure Whey Proteins](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000)? We have a wide range of different flavours to choose from.

The professors are now considering a longer-term clinical trial to discover if these benefits are long-lasting.
