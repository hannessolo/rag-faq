Fir’s Instagram account is one of our favourites and with this mouthwatering recipe you can see why. Just look at it. 934 ♥s says it all.

Fresh from the Emerald Isle, Fir has whipped up these gorgeous Cacao Sweet Potato Protein Pancakes using our Chocolate Peanut Beef Protein Isolate 97, ideal for anyone who can’t consume dairy or gluten.

Get involved and stack them high!

### Instructions:

1.) Put all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until a smooth batter forms.

2.) Heat a little coconut oil in a large non-stick pan and fry the pancakes for about one minute on each side. They are ready to flip when bubbles appear on the surface. You will need to re-oil the pan for each batch. You can expect about 8 medium sized pancakes from the above ingredients (4 per person).

3.) Serve with whatever toppings/fruit of your choice. I suggest strawberries, banana and almond butter!
