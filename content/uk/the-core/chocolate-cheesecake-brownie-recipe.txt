When you combine two dessert monoliths in the form of cheesecake and chocolate brownie, something magical happens; a food monster, one so enticing and hunger-crushing, is born. Our maverick baker, Hebe, has created just this: a Chocolate Cheesecake Brownie Recipe, and it is truly glorious!

### Instructions:

1) Preheat the oven to 160C.

2) In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients. Add in the wet ingredients and blend together. Let the batter sit for a few minutes.

3.) Scrape into a lined 20cm square tin, pour over the cheesecake and swirl with a skewer. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Carefully remove from the tin to fully cool on a wire rack. It firms up on cooling.
