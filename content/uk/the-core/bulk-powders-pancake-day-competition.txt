### Picture Your Pancakes

Tomorrow is Pancake Day! What better way to celebrate than a BULK POWDERSâ„¢ Pancake competition. Our Instagram account is growing and weâ€™ve seen loads of pictures of your BULK POWDERSâ„¢ inspired cooking creations from cakes to pancakes to pizzas to flapjacks. Itâ€™s time to dust down your apron, get tossing some pancakes and send us a snap to show just how good your culinary skills really are.

Protein pancakes or not, it doesnâ€™t matter. We would love to see you using some of our ingredients to make your pancakes such as Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ and Liquid Egg Whites but at the same time we want anyone to get involved. So there are no rules here, just make your pancakes, send us a photo and cross your fingers.

**Be as creative as you can be! Get funky with your toppings, make your picture stand out from the crowd.**

### What is the prize?

The winner of the Picture Your Pancake competition will get 6 x 1kg bottles of our best selling Liquid Egg Whites worth Â£21.99 plus a 1kg pouch of Pure Whey Protein (flavour of your choice). Thatâ€™s a total prize worth nearly Â£40. Not bad for just taking a picture and sending it to us (and lets be honest, youâ€™re going to take a picture and post it on Instagram anyway arenâ€™t youâ€¦) ðŸ™‚

Itâ€™s really easy to take part but we thought it best to outline how to do so below so youâ€™re totally clear on what you need to do. You can enter on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or just email us!

### How we pick the winner

Every photo that enters gets automatically put into the public vote on our Facebook competition application, [Woobox](http://woobox.com/iv9j8y). Weâ€™ll then leave it up to you and your mates to vote!

It takes a second to vote and whichever photo gets the most votes will win.

So tell your mates once youâ€™ve entered and get them to jump in and vote for your pancakes. Spread the word on social media if you REALLY want to win. They must go into [Woobox](http://woobox.com/iv9j8y) to vote for their favourite pancakes (how to shown below).

### How to enter and vote

This competition is now closed.
