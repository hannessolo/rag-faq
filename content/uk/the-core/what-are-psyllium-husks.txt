Psyllium Husks are a fantastic source of fibre, delivering approximately 80g fibre per 100g. That’s pretty good going! They are derived from the seed of the Plantago Ovata plant, which is found throughout Europe, Africa and Asia.

### **Why would you consume Psyllium husks?**

#### Digestion.

We mentioned the high fibre content, right? One of the main benefits of [psyllium husks](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/psyllium-husks-powder/bpb-phus-0000) is their ability to promote ‘regularity’ and aid digestion. High-protein, low-carb diets are often lacking in fibre content, which can impact on our health. Supplementing with psyllium husks can redress the balance.

#### Increased Satiety.

Psyllium husks are also beneficial for increasing the feeling of fullness. When combined with water for example, it expands in the stomach and suppresses appetite. Popular amongst bodybuilders and physique competitors, psyllium husks regulate feelings of hunger, which is ideal when macronutrients are in short supply, in the lead up to competition.

#### Blood Sugar Levels.

It is also believed that psyllium husks, and an increase in soluble fibre in the diet, can help to manage blood sugar levels. As such, this product is often popular with people working towards a specific weight loss goal, as well as people with diabetes – who need to be extra careful with changes in blood glucose.

### **What makes our Psyllium husks so good?**

Our [psyllium husks](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/psyllium-husks-powder/bpb-phus-0000) come in powder form. They are finely ground, making them easy to supplement with, as opposed to ‘Whole Psyllium Husks’, which many companies supply.

### **Incorporating Psyllium Husks in your diet.**

Mix 1/2 scoop (approximately 2g) with 350-500ml water, in a BULK POWDERS™ Shaker Bottle, or mixed in with food.

Psyllium Husks go hand-in-hand with a healthy diet full of vitamins and nutrients. As such, we would highly recommend supplementing with [Complete Greens](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-greens/bble-cgre)™ on a daily basis and a potent multivitamin, such as [Complete Multivitamin Complex](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-multivitamin-complex/bble-cmvc)™.
