General Health and Wellbeing is essential for you leading a happy life day-to-day, so what better way to stay on top of things, than our range of products which help to support this goal? This will guide you through our range of **Top 5 supplements for Health & Wellbeing**, no matter what sport you play, whether you’re a bodybuilder, powerlifter or runner, male or female, these supplements are suitable for all.

Multivitamin/Multimineral.
--------------------------

Multivitamin and Multimineral supplements have long been popular amongst the elite athlete diet, especially when dieting and micronutrients are sparse with a calorie-restricted diet. However, Multivitamin and Multimineral supplements are effective for all, whether you are dieting or not. Some of the vitamins and minerals within these products are essential for metabolic processes in the body, such as creating energy. In addition, regardless of diet and other environmental factors (such as sunlight), large portions of the population are actually deficient in certain vitamins and minerals – [Zinc](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/optizinc-tablets/bpb-ozin-0000) and [Vitamin D](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamins/vitamin-d) being prime examples. Multivitamin/multimineral supplements have a broad range of benefits, which stretch much wider than you may think. Some ingredients within our Multivitamin and Multimineral supplements can help to **support healthy skin, healthy hair, healthy nails, heart health, gut health, nervous system health, cognitive health and protective cells from oxidative stress** (antioxidants). We have two fantastic Multivitamin/Multimineral products:

**[SPORTS MULTI AM:PM](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/sports-multi-am-pm/bpps-smul)™** – Our premium Multivitamin product split into two doses AM and PM suiting the vitamins and minerals to that specific time of day. Using the best forms and chelates of minerals, this product is above and beyond the competition.

**[Complete Multivitamin Complex](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-multivitamin-complex/bble-cmvc)™** – Our simple, 3-a-day formula provides you with a well-dosed range of Vitamins, Minerals, Probiotics and Antioxidants.

Greens.
-------

Greens products are becoming increasingly popular for promoting general health and wellbeing amongst a broad range of supplement users. **Greens products offer a convenient and easy way to consume a variety of fruits, vegetables and healthful foods**. Greens products offer a wide range of benefits due to being a great source of vitamins, minerals, fibre, phytonutrients and antioxidants. In addition, our greens products offer more than 5 of your 5 a day per serving, making it an ultra-convenient and cost-effective source of fruits and vegetables, particularly for those who are lacking them in their current diet. We currently stock one of the best ranges of [Greens Powders](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/greens-supplements) on the market:

**Complete Greens™ Powder** – 24 nutrient-dense green foods, equivalent to more than 5 of your 5 a day, including ingredients featuring highly on the ORAC Scale.

**Complete Greens™ Tablets 1000mg** – the same formula as our **Complete Greens™ Powder**, however, is available in a tablet format with no excipients, fillers or other ingredients which you may find in competitor products.

**Complete Greens Protein Smoothie™** – we have combined **Complete Greens™** with Whey Protein, Beef Pollen Powder, Coconut Flour and real Blueberry Powder (and pieces) to create an authentic, nutrient-dense smoothie.

Fish Oils.
----------

[Fish oils](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/fish-oils) are an excellent source of Omega 3 and in particular the omega 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA which have been associated with a wide range of health benefits – most notably its effect on contributing to normal heart function. Fish oils have also been shown to have benefits to mental health, blood lipid levels (cholesterol, triglycerides etc.), reducing inflammation and reducing muscle soreness. All of which can help to benefit your general health and wellbeing, no matter what your goals are! In addition to these benefits, fish oil supplements are great as it is difficult to consume sufficient fish oil/EPA/DHA from food sources. We have a wide range of Fish oil products which you can find below:

**[Omega 3 Fish Oil Softgels 1000mg](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/omega-3-fish-oil-softgels/bpb-omg3-0000)** – containing 1000mg of fish oil with 180mg of EPA and 120mg of DHA per softgel, this is a fantastic source of Omega 3.

**[Super Strength Omega 3 Capsules 1000mg](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/super-strength-omega-3-softgels/bpb-o3ss-0000)** – containing 1000mg of fish oil with 330mg of EPA and 220mg of DHA per softgel, this is highly concentrated fish oil, making supplementing with Omega 3 even easier.

**[Krill Oil Softgels 500mg](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/krill-oil-softgels/bpb-koil-0000)** – derived from premium Arctic Krill, our Krill Oil Softgels provide a superb source of Omega 3, Phospholipids and Astaxanthin.

Probiotics.
-----------

Probiotics have long been overlooked in their ability to promote general health and wellbeing, however recent research has begun to highlight that these microorganisms certainly have their benefits. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are shown to have “good” effects in the gut. When people hear of microorganisms they typically associate them with negative health, or illness, however probiotics have been described as friendly bacteria that can help to promote health. Probiotics are particularly beneficial for digestive health and immune system health. We offer two fantastic probiotic products, as well as adding probiotics to a number of our protein-based products.

**[Complete Bio-Culture](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-bio-culture/bble-cpro)™** – containing almost 8 billion colony forming units, as well as Betaine HCL and digestive enzymes, this will help to promote digestive health.

As you can see we have a wide range of products to help promote general health and wellbeing which anyone can add to their daily supplement arsenal. So why not give these a try and see how it affects your everyday life.
