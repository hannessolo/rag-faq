Why do you eat clean, track your macros, prep your food and supplement your diet? A hot bod is a great side product, but here’s how to nail down nutrition for health.

Lots of gym-goers and bodybuilders have one goal in mind when they clean up their diet and get their supplements in order. How their body is going to look. We’re not going to lie, a lean and muscular physique is important to us, too. But we’ve come to realise the importance of nutrition for long-term health, performance and recovery too.

We’ve blogged before about the benefits of using a supergreens powder alongside your more traditional bodybuilding supplement stack of protein, creatine and aminos. But you could use single-ingredient fruit and vegetable supplements to really take your sports nutrition to the next level.

Here are 5 of the top supplements for health-focused nutrition.
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Kale powder

You already know that kale is one of the most nutritious veggies you can eat. Like most dark, leafy greens, it packs a powerful punch, full of micronutrients, anti oxidants and fibre. Kale powder is a very useful way to get all the benefits of the raw plant into your daily diet without having to store, chop, steam and munch your way through a pile of leaves. [Kale powder supplement](../../kale-powder.html "Kale powder") is vegan and vegetarian and free from gluten, lactose, dairy and soya.

### Spinach powder

Another fantastic leafy green is spinach. As a powdered nutritional supplement, you get all the incredible benefits of raw spinach in a highly concentrated dose. We all know how much spinach shrinks down when you cook it. And, if you want to eat your spinach raw, you need to buy, store and chop mountains of it to meet your micronutrient needs! Using a raw [spinach powder](../../spinach-powder.html "Spinach powder") gets around both problems: all the benefits of spinach without the volume (and food prep).

### Sweet Potato powder

This is a really exciting real-food supplement! [Sweet potato powder](../../sweet-potato-powder.html "Sweet Potato powder") is literally powdered sweet potato, a convenient and user-friendly version of every bodybuilder’s favourite carb source. It tastes just like sweet potato (funnily enough) and is a great carb source for bodybuilders, dieters and anyone who likes to bake healthy snacks. Like the sweet potato itself, sweet potato powder is high in carbohydrates and fibre but low on the glycaemic index. It’s packed with vitamins and minerals and is gluten, dairy, lactose and soya free.

### Broccoli powder

Another bodybuilder diet staple is the humble head of broccoli. In powdered form, it’s a simply fantastic source of multiple antioxidants, vitamins and minerals at high, concentrated levels. We [powder GM-free broccoli](../../broccoli-powder.html "Broccoli powder") using a very low temperature dehydration method so the integrity of the raw veg is kept intact. We’d suggest that anyone who wants to get a bodybuilder’s physique should be using powdered versions of all the classic bodybuilder veggies!
