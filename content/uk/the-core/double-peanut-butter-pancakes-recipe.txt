Instructions
------------

1.) Blend all of the ingredients together until smooth. At this point feel free to add chocolate chips to the mixture.

2.) Next pour the mixture into a non stick frying pan on medium heat until bubbles form in the pancake. This means the pancake is ready to be flipped to cook the other side.

3.) Cook until fluffy.
