When she’s not in the forests of Nottingham stealing macros from the rich to give to the poor, Chef Hebe can be found labouring in the BULK POWDERS™ kitchen, concocting the kind of recipes that make your face go ‘Ooooooo’.  This is a delicious Chocolate Cupcakes & Chocolate Icing recipe, combining our popular [Beef Protein Isolate](../../beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef.html) with a number of ingredients including: Quinoa and Coconut Flour.

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 180C.

2.) Combine all the ingredients together in a bowl, stir well and blend until smooth.

3.) Divide between three or four silicone cases and bake for 20-25 minutes.

4.) Meanwhile, make the icing. Add the cocoa, peanut flour and water and mix to a thinnish paste. Microwave for 30 seconds, stirring in-between. Add the icing sugar if using, and the [Beef Protein Isolate](../../beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef.html). Stir until smooth. Microwave for another 30 seconds, stirring in-between.

5.) Stir in the salt and leave to cool and thicken up. Stick in the freezer for speed. Note: at this point you can also add a blob of coconut milk yoghurt, greek yoghurt or cream cheese if you wish.
