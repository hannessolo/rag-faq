Have you ever tried baking muffins but it didn’t pan out the way you thought it would? The muffins didn’t rise or worse still, the mix looked and tasted like a bit of a mess?

Fear not, friends. We have just launched our very own **[Chia Seed Muffin Mix](../../chia-seed-muffin-mix.html)™** meaning you can now make home-baked muffins with absolute ease – prepared and baked in less than 30 minutes!

The Chia Seed Muffin Mix**™** is high in protein, with an **impressive 32% protein content**. In fact, 12 muffins contain a massive 65g protein! The protein content is derived from a combination of Whey Protein, Milk Protein and Egg Protein, all of which contribute to the growth and maintenance of muscle mass.

We’ve sourced all the key ingredients for you, now it’s up to you to get baking!

**What you will need:**

12 paper muffin cases

2 large eggs

200ml milk / water (or non-dairy milk e.g. almond or soya milk)

3tbsp **[Coconut Oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "Coconut Oil")** / butter (melted)

**Instructions.**

1.) Pre-heat oven to 160°C / gas mark 5 (fan assisted oven / gas oven).

2.) Add 2 eggs to a mixing bowl and whisk.

3.) Melt the **Coconut Oil** / butter in a microwave (checking every 20 seconds).

4.) Add the 200ml milk, and **Coconut Oil** / butter to the mixing bowl, along with the eggs.

5.) Pour in the **BULK POWDERS™ Chia Seed Muffin Mix™** and mix well with a spoon.

6.) Spoon the mixture into 12 muffin cases (so that the muffins don’t overflow, fill no more than half of the muffin case).

7.) Place on the middle shelf of a pre-heated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden.

8.) Remove from the oven and allow for the muffins to cool for a couple of minutes before transferring to a cooling rack for a further 20-30 minutes.

9.) Enjoy your muffins as a high protein snack at any time of the day! Store in an air tight container for up to 3 days.
