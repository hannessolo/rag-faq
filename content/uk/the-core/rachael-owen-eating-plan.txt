Eating Plans.
-------------

We all aspire to improve ourselves and a great way to do this is to learn from others, and people around us. Use this series to learn about the diet of athletes and professionals and understand how small changes to your own diet plan and eating habits could help you reach your fitness and lifestyle goals.

### Introducing Rachael Owen.

Rachael is one of our sponsored athletes and a successful PT and natural bodybuilder. Having originally competed in bikini physique, she is now aiming towards natural figure and has recently qualified for the British finals! With a busy lifestyle and a demanding training plan, Rachael has found higher carbohydrates, moderate protein and moderate-to-low fats works most effectively for her. This split allows her to achieve the increases in lean muscle mass she needs for competition, without any excess fat gain.

The foundation for Rachael’s diet is as follows:

**Daily Macros:** 50% carbohydrates, 40% protein, 10% fats.

Here is a breakdown of what Rachael eats on a typical day – fitting in around her work and training.

### Breakfast.

*   500ml of water with one [Complete Multivitamin Complex](../../complete-multivitamin-complex.html "Complete Multivitamin Complex")**™** _&_ one small scoop of [glutamine](../../glutamine.html "Glutamine"), leucine, instant BCAA, creatine monohydrate and HMB.
*   200ml of liquid egg whites or one scoop of chocolate orange Pure Whey Protein_™_
*   One bowl of rolled porridge oats with water & a teaspoon of crunchy [roasted peanut butter](../../peanut-butter.html "Crunchy Peanut Butter")_._
*   Normally for breakfast I’ll have a balance of protein, carbohydrates and fats to fire me up for the day and sustain energy levels.
*   I sometimes like to have my scoop of protein warm, by mixing it with a dash of water into a paste consistency and microwaving for two minutes.

### **Mid-Morning.**

*   500ml of water.
*   Half a chicken breast with a [Complete Greens](../../complete-greens.html "Complete Greens")**™** shake.
*   One small sweet or white potato.
*   I use white or sweet potato as I find I can digest these both easily.
*   I always incorporate a good amount of greens and vegetables into my diet to maintain a high fibre intake.

### Lunch.

*   500ml of water.
*   A small turkey breast steak with green vegetables and a handful of basmati rice.
*   Lunch isn’t too dissimilar to mid-morning – I usually mix up the protein source, so if I had chicken mid-morning I may have turkey for lunch.
*   If I’m on the move, I find the small microwave packs of rice are extremely handy.

### Late Afternoon.

*   500ml of water.
*   Half a chicken breast with a green leafy salad.
*   One small sweet or white potato.
*   I like my potatoes cooked in many ways. Mashed, baked and even cut into wedges, oven grilled for about 25minutes with a sprinkle of [Active Seasonings](../../active-seasonings.html)™ to give them a bit more taste. My favourite flavour is probably Lemon & Herb, but Piri Piri is a close second.

### Post Workout.

*   2 litres of water during training.
*   Post workout I’ll have one scoop of [HydroBEEF](../../beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef.html "Beef Protein Isolate")™ _(_mixed with one small scoop of glutamine, leucine, [instant BCAA](../../instantised-bcaa.html "Instant BCAA"), creatine monohydrate and HMB_)._
*   One medium banana.
*   If I don’t train I miss out my post workout meal, as my body doesn’t require the extra calories.

### Evening.

*   500ml of water.
*   A small turkey breast or half tin of tuna in brine with green vegetables.
*   One bowl of rolled porridge oats with water.
*   Green tea.
*   [Complete Protein Dessert](../../shop-by-range/complete-series/complete-protein-dessert.html "Complete Protein Dessert")™ is a great occasional treat without the dreaded high calorie, carbohydrate or fat content and really helps get rid of that sweet tooth.
*   Before bed one small scoop of glutamine, leucine, instant BCAA, [creatine monohydrate](../../creatine-monohydrate.html "Creatine Monohydrate") and [HMB](https://www.bulk.com/uk/hmb-powder-2.html "HMB").

### Summary.

As you can see from Rachael’s eating plan, she doesn’t shy away from calories. Her diet is structured to support her goals as a physique competitor but also as an athlete who trains hard and needs fuel to power her recovery. She keeps her diet and food interesting by switching between different sources of protein and uses Active Seasonings**™** to add a bit more flavour where needed.
