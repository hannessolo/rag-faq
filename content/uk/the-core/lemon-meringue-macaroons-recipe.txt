Aisling has been busy in the kitchen working on these cheeky Lemon Meringue Macaroons with a tiny ingredients list. Some say it tastes like rainbows, others say it tastes like Lemon Meringue Macaroons. Who cares about finding a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow when you can find these golden â€˜roons instead. Go get â€™em.

### Instructions:

1.) Preheat the oven to 180C.  
2.) Combine the desiccated coconut to Lemon Meringue Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ and add a few drops of water until a thick consistency. Have a taste and add Stevia / LiquiFlavâ„¢ if desired.  
3.) Spoon a teaspoon amount onto baking parchment/wax paper & flatten down a little.  
4.) Pop in the oven for up to 15 minutes or until the edges start to golden.  
5.) Eat them all ðŸ™‚

For added yumminess, slap two macaroons together with a Greek Yoghurt filling or Coyo for a dairy free option!
