Nutrition is the main stumbling block for so many but it is widely considered the most important area to address when trying to improve general health and body aesthetics. **_You can’t out train a bad diet…_**

A supplement like our [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html "Pure Whey Protein")™ can be invaluable for people who train frequently and need an accessible and convenient source of high quality protein and amino acids. Protein is widely known to increase satiety too, so it is a great addition to any diet when appetite and convenience is an important consideration.

### It’s not all about Protein

But it’s not all about our protein powders. We’ve spent a great deal of time developing our range of [Active Foods](../../shop-by-range/active-foods.html "Active Foods")™, made from real ingredients, to cater for a growing need for functional foods that deliver quality proteins, carbs and fats for people who are active.

It’s these real foods that could make a significant impact to your diet and eating habits, particularly addressing areas such as healthy snacking foods, low GI breakfast options, plus healthier choices for popular spreads such as peanut butter.

**Here are 5 real food supplements we think you’ll love:**

### **Complete Protein Porridge™**

Whether breakfast is truly the most important meal of the day is debatable, but if you need some fire in your belly first thing in the morning, our [Complete Protein Porridge](../../complete-protein-porridge.html "Complete Protein Porridge")™ will keep you energised through till lunch. By consuming slow release carbohydrates at breakfast, you are ensuring that your blood sugar levels are kept constant – preventing an unwanted mid-morning energy crash and any unwanted calories from bad snacking.

### **Beef Jerky**

One of our newest product launches, [Beef Jerky](../../beef-jerky.html "Beef Jerky") is suitable for anyone who wants a high protein savoury snack at any time of the day. Protein helps build, repair and maintain muscle mass and with 60g protein per pack, Beef Jerky will help you considerably increase your protein intake, without high levels of carbohydrate and fat. Reach for the jerky next time you’re feeling a bit peckish – the nutritionals are great and it’ll stop you some snacking on things you shouldn’t.

### **Diet Noodles**

Another newcomer, our [Diet Noodles](../../diet-noodles.html "Diet Noodles") are perfect if you are watching your calorie intake but don’t want to have an empty plate when it comes to meal times. The noodles are manufactured from Glucomannan, which is a form of water soluable fibre and has been shown in research to contribute to weight loss, through an increase in satiety. When you cook up your chicken and vegetables next time around, consider adding some Diet Noodles to the party for something a bit more satisfying.

### **Peanut Butter**

[![Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/020115_Peanut-Butter.jpg)](https://www.bulk.com/uk/peanut-butter.html)

Our [Peanut Butter](../../peanut-butter.html "Peanut Butter") is a calorie dense source of protein and healthy fats and is entirely natural, containing nothing but great-tasting, whole roast peanuts. The fats profile, which is comprised mainly of monounsaturates and polyunsaturates, is shown to help lower cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease and attribute to weight control – provided it is used sensibly. The only problem is, it tastes so good!

### **Coconut Oil**

[![Organic Virgin Coconut Oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/020115_Organic-Virgin-Coconut-Oil.jpg)](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html)

If you happen to do a lot of home cooking or baking, consider switching to Organic Virgin [Coconut Oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "Coconut Oil") as a healthier alternative to common cooking oils such as Sunflower oil or Vegetable oil. Coconut Oil, which is packed full of MCT’s is believed to have a positive impact on body composition. MCT’s, unlike LCT’s that are found in inferior cooking oils, are converted to energy by the body, rather than stored as fat.

If you are looking for healthier food choices to add to your diet, consider these supplements and see how you get on.
