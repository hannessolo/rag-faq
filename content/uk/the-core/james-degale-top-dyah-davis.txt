On Saturday night, in front of a packed Glow Arena, James DeGale once again successfully defended his WBC Silver belt with a classy display against American Dyah Davis. All three judges scored the fight 118-110 in favour of DeGale (meaning that DeGale won 10 out of the 12 rounds on all the judges’ scorecards).

From the first round, Davis struggled to land any clean shots on DeGale. Davis’ trainer admitted in the post-fight press conference that DeGale’s movement made him very difficult to hit. DeGale kept the pressure up on Davis, landing several eye catching combinations. Davis, who has sparred many top fighters, including Bernard Hopkins, knew all of the tricks of the trade and kept trying to grab DeGale on the inside in an attempt to smother his work. DeGale kept calm and refused to get frustrated; it was during one of these clinches that DeGale landed a shot that broke the jaw of Davis.

DeGale kept applying the pressure throughout the rounds, often forcing Davis back onto the ropes. DeGale has an unique ability to successfully switch from his natural southpaw stance to orthodox, and he put it to good use throughout the fight changing his angles of attack. At the halfway point, all ringside observers had DeGale 6 rounds up. Davis proved his heart, fighting on with a broken jaw and he enjoyed a small period of success around the 8th round. However, normal business resumed during the championship rounds as DeGale applied more pressure, slipping Davis’ shots and landing with crisp counters.

After the scores were announced, a delighted DeGale was announced the winner. He said “Davis is a good fighter, far better than many gave him credit for. I now want to move on and fight for titles – I’m ranked highly by all governing bodies and I want the big fights.”

Congratulations, James, from all at [BULK POWDERS™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/).
