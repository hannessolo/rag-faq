February is a month full of love and romance! To celebrate, we have recipes for you and your sweetheart that can be enjoyed all year round – not just Valentine’s Day.

Product of the Month
--------------------

This month, we fell in love with Peanut Butter. Smooth or crunchy, sweet or savoury, Peanut Butter can be used in more ways than you can imagine!

Our Active Foods™ [Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/peanut-butter.html) is a calorie dense source of protein and monounsaturated fats. It is high in protein, which contributes to both the growth and maintenance of muscle mass.

Active Foods™ Peanut Butter is entirely natural, containing nothing but great-tasting, whole roasted peanuts! It provides an excellent source of high quality protein and healthy fats, whilst avoiding added salt, sugar, palm oil and preservatives.

To mix things up, you could try [Coconut Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/coconut-peanut-butter.html), made with just Peanuts, Coconut & Honey. Or, you could go for the [4 Seed Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/4-seed-peanut-butter.html), with the unique addition of 4 different seeds. This includes a combination of Linseeds, Chia Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds and Sunflower Seeds, which have all been included for their fantastic nutritional profile and luxurious taste.

Our Peanut Butters can be enjoyed on their own, as a spread, in cooking and baking, or even added to shakes to increase the calorie content and improve the taste.
