It feels like buying original Christmas presents to give to friends and family seems to get harder and harder every year now… but luckily BULK POWDERS™ is here to help with gift ideas to give your loved ones the perfect fitness fix this Christmas.

These Christmas gift ideas have been listed as gifts for him and gifts for her but of course this isn’t set in stone – chocolate, lifting gloves and foam rollers for instance can be enjoyed by men too (probably not the sports bra though…)!

And remember – self gifting is an important part of Christmas gift giving, so why not treat yourself too…

Christmas Gifts For Him
-----------------------

### Supplement Bundles

If the person you are buying for has just caught the gym bug then they may be new to things like supplements which can help aid a better performance from their workout. Look for bundle packages this time of year like [BULK POWDERS™ Starter Bundle For Him](https://www.bulk.com/uk/starter-bundle-for-him.html "Bulk Powders Starter Bundle for Him"). This starter bundle contains everything a beginner needs – whey protein, multivitamins, creatine monohydrate and a blender bottle for just £27.99 – perfect for setting him up for the year ahead. Alternatively you may wish to consider the [Fat Attack Stack](https://www.bulk.com/uk/fat-attack-stack.html "Fat Attack Stack") to kick start 2014 or the [Bulk Up Bundle](https://www.bulk.com/uk/bulking-bundle.html "Bulk Up Bundle") if gaining mass and size is the objective.

### SandRopes

SandRopes give you an intense workout not only for you shoulders but also your core and cardiovascular system. Although similar to battle ropes, as the name would suggest, they are filled with sand to help take your workout up a notch. If you have someone in mind who would love to add this innovation piece of equipment into their workout then it will cost around $180 (approx. £110).

### Dre Beats

Beats by Dre Studio Wireless are the perfect gift this season if you’re looking for something that is fashionable and functional. The latest headphones from Beats by Dre are wireless, so you control your phone call or your music on the headset – perfect for the gym goer to avoid getting their wires and weights tangled up. They cost around £250.

### The Vela Cycle

The Vela Cycle was described by Forbes as “The bike that looks like art” so this is home fitness equipment, but not as you know it! The bike projects images around your workout room, so you are fully immersed in your training experience. It also relays real time feedback during your training to help performance. When you’ve finished your workout, stepping off the bike, “it becomes a sculpture that reflects the user’s passion for their lifestyle…”. If this sounds like the perfect gift for someone you know, start saving now – it may not officially on the shelves just yet, but we feel pretty certain that this will be one pricey bike ride!

Christmas Gifts For Her
-----------------------

### 90% Dark Chocolate

If you know that the person you’re buying for has a bit of a sweet tooth but is keeping to a strict workout diet, the gift of Lindt 90% dark chocolate is ideal. Perfect for that something sweet after a meal or to dip protein bars into for that extra sweet kick, this is a guilt free treat! Available in most supermarkets, this sweet treat costs around £3.

### Foam Rollers

Aches and pains are an everyday part of the gym-goers life. But no matter what type of workout you are doing, foam rollers are great for releasing unwanted tension in the muscles or after you get injured. Prices start from £10 and can range up to anything like £40.

### Lifting Gloves

Weightlifting can take its toll on hands as well as muscles. Finding the right pair of lifting gloves can help transform the comfort and overall performance of their workout. If you know someone who has just started weightlifting than this is an ideal present.

Not sure which size to get? As a rule of thumb, glove size usually correlates with foot size. Check out Nike Pro Elevate weightlifting gloves for women which costs around $20 (approx. £12).

You might wish to consider Liquid Chalk as an alternative gift.

### Victoria’s Secret Sport Bras

Victoria’s Secret Sport Bras are perfect for the woman who loves to workout but doesn’t want to compromise on looking her best too. The Angel has Memory Fit technology & adjustable straps, while the VS Pro is light and breathable while offering maximum support. This performance workout gear will set you back roughly $40 – 60 (approx. £25 – £35).

### Garmin Forerunner 620

If you’re buying for someone that enjoys heading outside of the gym for their fitness fix, why not consider the Garmin Forerunner 620? This GPS running watch offers vibration alerts, a post-run summary, training plan support, run/walk alerts and much, much more. It’s on sale for around £325 – £350.
