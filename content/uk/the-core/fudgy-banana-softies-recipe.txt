The Goddess of the Golden Rock returns with this hypertrophic recipe of soft cookie gains. Fresh from a regenerating soak in the Gibraltan sun, Elke mustered up this seductive Fudgy Banana Softies recipe. Combining 5 of our fantastic products, these treats contain less than 60 calories each and make a great high protein snack.

### Instructions:

1.) Pre-heat oven to approx. 180 Degrees C.

2.) Mix all your ingredients in a bowl until all blended together.

3.) Then, using a tablespoon, spoon mix into muffin silicone molds. Due to them being soft cookies, if you put the mix straight on a baking tray they will spreadout. Using a muffin mold will keep them contained.

4.) Then proceed to bake for approx 10-15minutes, until cooked but soft to the touch.

5.) Once baked, remove from oven and leave to cool.

6.) Once cooled, place in fridge for an hour or so (this will help them solidify.)

### Get baking!
