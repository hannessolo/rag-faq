This World Vegetarian Day, we’re sharing some veggie-friendly recipe inspiration for anyone looking to shake up their midweek meal prep.

First up we’ve got a warming Autumn stew from #TeamBulk ambassador [@helenaeiken](https://www.instagram.com/helenaeiken/) using the peanut butter, quinoa, coconut flakes and cashew nuts from our Active Foods range.

**Ingredients (serves 4 people)**

To make the stew:

*   1 large onion, diced
*   1 inch of ginger, grated
*   2-3 cloves of garlic, minced
*   1/2-1 tablespoon curry powder
*   Juice from 1 lime
*   [2 tablespoons Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut)
*   1 can diced tomatoes
*   1 can full fat coconut milk
*   1-2 large sweet potatoes, in 1/2 inch cubes (optional: swap some for pumpkin)
*   1 can chickpeas
*   2-3 carrots, chopped
*   Water (optional: vegetable broth)
*   Olive oil
*   Salt and pepper, to taste

Cauliflower/quinoa:

*   1 cup of Organic Royal Quinoa Grain, cooked
*   1/2 head of cauliflower, finely processed/chopped
*   Salt and pepper, to taste

Topping:

*   Avocado
*   Dried Coconut
*   Whole Cashew Nuts
*   Coriander
*   Lime slice

**Instructions**

*   Sauté the onion, garlic, ginger and curry powder until the onion becomes translucent
*   Add the lime juice, coconut milk, diced tomatoes and peanut butter
*   Let it all simmer for 10-15 minutes. The longer the better, as this is where your stew will become deliciously creamy
*   Add sweet potatoes, chickpeas, carrots and salt & pepper. Let everything simmer until the vegetables are tender. 20-30 minutes should do it
*   Serve with a mix of finely processed cauliflower and quinoa., seasoned with salt and pepper
*   Top with lime, cilantro, cashews and Dried Coconut flakes
