Adam, founder of MyGym.co.uk, received a selection of ingredients, including [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™, [VitaFiber™ Powder](../../vitafiber-powder.html) and our awesome [Liquid Egg Whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html).

To satify his sweet tooth, Adam decided to create a **Walnut & Banana Protein Loaf**, to help with those 4pm cravings. Packed full of protein, sweet because of the Bananas and the VitaFiber™ Powder, you can make a loaf of this in one go, and take a slice with you to work or the gym each day. Perfect for when you need a sweet, but healthy snack!

Here’s how he made it:

### Method:

This really couldn’t be any simpler, get a bowl and mix all the ingredients together until you have a nice thick smooth pourable consistency.

Pour into a grease proof baking tin (use [coconut oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html) to greaseproof the tin) and bake in an oven at 170c for approx 45 – 50 minutes.

**Variations:** Instead of walnuts you could use chopped almonds or just exclude altogether and make **Banana Bread** using the same recipe. You can also try using other flavoured whey protein to creative something entirely different!
