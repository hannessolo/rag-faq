Unfortunately, despite what some sports nutrition companies will have you believe, there is no magic pill or silver bullet for weight loss. The success of your weight loss journey will ultimately be determined by your commitment to change, and your discipline to stick to a healthier lifestyle – whether that’s being more active, eating better foods or being smarter with your supplementation.

### You will succeed.

It is never a quick fix. In order to achieve the health you crave, and the body you desire, you need to be willing to put the work in. There will be challenges along the way and you will face obstacles that seem at times impossible to overcome, but you will succeed and you will feel amazing for doing so.

So now that we’ve established you’re serious about losing a few pounds, here are 3 supplements we think you could benefit from:

**CUTTING EDGE™**

[CUTTING EDGE](../../cutting-edge.html "CUTTING EDGE")™, part of our Pro Series range, is our most effective fat loss supplement and the most advanced weight loss product on the market. It is optimally dosed with ingredients that are proven to promote increased satiety (feeling of fullness, which prevents unnecessary snacking), lipid metabolism, thyroid function and improved digestion.

As with all our supplements, you can see exactly what you’re getting. The CUTTING EDGE™ formula contains powerful ingredients, including:

*   [Glucomannan](../../glucomannan-konjac-powder.html "Glucomannan") (3000mg)
*   Green Coffee Extract (400mg)
*   L-Phenylalanine (400mg)
*   Caffeine (300mg)
*   Cinnamon Extract (250mg)
*   Peppermint Leaf Powder (50mg)
*   Choline Bitartrate (50mg)
*   BioPerine® (5mg)
*   Chromium Picolinate (1mg – 2500% RDA)
*   and Selenium Methionine 55mcg (100% RDA)

If snacking is a problem for you, CUTTING EDGE™ could be the supplement that helps you break the habit of a lifetime.

**Complete Thermogenic™**

The power of [Complete Thermogenic](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-thermogenic/bble-cthe "Complete Thermogenic")™ is an exciting array of research-proven ingredients that contribute to a reduction in perceived exertion during exercise. For this very reason, Complete Thermogenic™ is a fantastic supplement of choice if exercise and training is the focus of your weight loss efforts – you’ll be able to train harder for longer, burning more calories as you go.

**Complete Diet Protein™ ADVANCED**

[Complete Diet Protein™ ADVANCED](../../complete-diet-protein-advanced.html "Complete Diet Protein ADVANCED") is a new and improved version of our hugely popular Complete Diet Protein™. We’ve reduced the carbohydrate content by half and included Glucomannan, one of the most effective ingredients on the market for increasing the feeling of satiety.

The addition of Clarinol® CLA Powder, which research suggests helps in the reduction of brown adipose tissue (fat) and an increase in lean body mass, as well as [Acetyl L-Carnitine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/acetyl-l-carnitine/bpb-alca-0000 "L Carnitine"), which is required for the metabolism of fat and is thought to improve the rate of fat oxidation, makes for a powerful combination.

If you need a supplement which combines a premium protein blend with research-proven weight loss ingredients, Complete Diet Protein™ ADVANCED might be the best supplement you’ve never tried.

Add one of these supplements to your new weight loss plan and see how you get on. With a structured training programme and sensible lifestyle changes, we think you’ll be surprised by what you can do.
