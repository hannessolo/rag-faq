Instructions
------------

1.) Mix milk and vinegar and set aside. This needs to be done so that the vinegar reacts with the milk and ‘curdles’.

2.) Mix all of the dry ingredients in a bowl, and then fold in the wet ingredients.

3.) Heat waffle machine as per instructions, and using a ladle spoon, pour your mix on to the machine. It will take 2-3 minutes to cook.

It’s as easy as that!

Yields 6 waffles.
