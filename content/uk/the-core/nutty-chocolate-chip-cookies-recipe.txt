Bursting with flavour and a gooey chocolate centre, here’s a Nutty Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.) Preheat the oven to 170c and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.

2.) Combine the peanut flour, almond flour, bicarbonate of soda and coconut palm sugar in a bowl.

3.) Stir in the oil, milk and vanilla. Mix together until it creates a sticky dough.

4.) Fold in the chocolate chips.

5.) Spoon one tablespoon of the mixture onto the pre-lined baking tray and flatten. Repeat to fill entire tray.

6.) Bake for 8-10 minutes until golden.

7.) Leave to cool completely and then place in fridge for 30 minutes before serving – the cookies are very soft straight out of the oven!

Recipe makes approx. 10 cookies.
