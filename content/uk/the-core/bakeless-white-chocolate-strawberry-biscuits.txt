### Summary

Try this great tasting Bakeless White Chocolate Strawberry Biscuits recipe for a healthy treat, that feels a little bit naughty. This recipe contains our white chocolate Pure Whey, some coconut oil and a sprinkling of flaxseed, so you’re guaranteed quality protein, slow release carbs and good fats, with every bite.

### Instructions

1.) Melt the coconut oil in a pan or in a bowl if using a microwave, then add the remaining ingredients.

2.) You can proceed to make these two ways… by pressing batter into a mould like we did or rolling flat onto greaseproof baking paper and cutting later. Both ways require refrigeration.

3.) Leave for half hour for your dough to harden, you can then pop them out of mould or cut them with a cookie cutter.
