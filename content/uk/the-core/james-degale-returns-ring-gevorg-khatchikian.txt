BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale returns to action on Saturday 1st March, defending his WBC Silver title against undefeated Gevorg Khatchikian. The fight will be shown live on Channel 5. Khatchikan boasts an impressive record on paper and is unbeaten in 20 fights – he’ll be coming to win.

Looking forward, DeGale has a final eliminator confirmed against Badou Jack, with the winner going on to fight for the WBC world title (currently held by Sakio Bika). The Jack fight goes to purse bids in March, and is likely to take place in early May in either Las Vegas or London. For DeGale, the Khatchikian fight could be seen as a fight that is difficult to get motivated for as the Jack fight carries far more significance. However, DeGale is having none of that. He said “I can’t wait to get back in the ring – all of my attention is on Khatchikian and he’s in for a tough night!”

DeGale clocked up three wins in 2013 against experienced opponents (they had 79 wins between them), but fought all of the year hampered by injury. After beating Dyah Davis, DeGale had a groin operation and now feels better than ever. He said “fighting injured is part of the game, but it’s incredible how much better I feel now. I’ve been doing loads of things in training for this fight that I couldn’t do before as I was restricted by injury.”

The British Boxing Board of Control check the weight of fighters at various points in the lead up to fights, to ensure they are making weight safely. As always, James was in perfect shape for his check-weigh and is raring to go for Saturday!

Follow James’ progress on Twitter @jamesdegale1 and be sure to tune in to Channel 5 on Saturday night!
