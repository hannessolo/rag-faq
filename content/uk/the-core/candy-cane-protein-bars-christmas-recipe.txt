Get festive with your protein treats this December with our Candy Cane Protein Bars Christmas recipe.

**INSTRUCTIONS**
----------------

1.) In a bowl mix together VitaFiber™ and water and microwave for 30 seconds. Whisk and microwave for another 30 seconds. If you would prefer to do this on the hob, simply heat up the water and VitaFiber™ mix to a boil and keep whisking until the VitaFiber™ has dissolved and you’re left with a liquid only.

2.) Fold in cashew butter first, don’t rush or throw in the remaining ingredients because it will affect the outcome.

3.) Mix in remaining ingredients until well combined, using your hands if necessary.

4.) Line a square silicone tray with clingfilm (to make it easier to remove later) and press your mix evenly into it.

5.) Place in freezer for up to an hour or until solidified enough to slice.

6.) Slice into 12 pieces and place back in freezer while you melt the chocolate.

7.) Line a tray with baking paper or foil then melt chocolate in a glass bowl over boiling water or in microwave. If you want your chocolate to melt a little bit runnier, add some [coconut oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html) but bear in mind this will change the overall nutritional profile.

8.) Dip all the bars in the chocolate and place on tray, topping each with the crushed peppermint sticks.

9.) Then place in fridge for half an hour or so for them to harden.
