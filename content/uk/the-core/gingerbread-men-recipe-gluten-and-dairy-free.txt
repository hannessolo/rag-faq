When you think of Christmas, you imagine snow (pah!), santa, a tree, decor, presents, family andâ€¦ gingerbread latte. But when you have a latte, you need something to dip into it right? Swap a digestive or Hobnob for a tasty Gingerbread Man!

Each gingerbread bro has less than 100 cals. Seasonal snacking at its finest. Cheers The Muscle Bakery.

### Instructions:

1.) Mix all dry ingredients into a bowl and set aside.

2.) In a mixer bowl, add Vitalite, egg and sweetener and beat on a low speed.

3.) Slowly add in melted coconut oil and molasses and increase to a medium speed

4.) Add dry mix slowly until a doughy consistency forms, then wrap in cling film and refrigerate for up to 1 hour.

5.) Spread and flatten mix onto a sheet of greaseproof paper using your hands (we found it easier this way than with a rolling pin as it crumbles away with a rolling pin) and using your cutter, cut your gingerbread men shapes transferring to a lined baking tray.

6.) Bake in oven for 10-15 until golden around the edges.

7.) Leave to cool completely before adding icing

Icing:

8.) Whisk egg and vinegar together until fluffy then fold in Sukrin icing until desired consistency. (Not watery but not too stiff)

9.) Add to piping bag and decorate as desired.
