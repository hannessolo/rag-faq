Sophie, creator of the beauty blog [AllDolledUp](http://alldolledup.co.uk/), received some goodies that included our market leading [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™ and [Liquid Egg Whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html). As a firm believer in ‘everything in moderation’, and that eating healthy food should not be a chore, Sophie decided to give one of her favourite foods a healthy makeover.

After a bit of searching and recipe testing, she has managed to create a pizza base that is not only healthy but packed with protein too, perfect for that post-workout feed!

Here’s how she made it:

### Method:

Turn on the grill to the highest setting and heat a tablespoon of [coconut oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html) in a frying pan over a medium heat.

Measure out your base ingredients and transfer to your blender/Nutribullet.

Blast in the blender/Nutribullet for 30 seconds until you have a ‘pancake’ consistency.

Pour your mixture into the frying pan and tilt until you have a pizza sized ‘pancake’. Let it cook for a minute or so and flip to the other side and cook again for  1 minute.

When the ‘pancake’ is browned (but not burnt) remove from the pan onto a plate.

Using a spatula, cover your base with tomato puree and then arrange your toppings.

Transfer to the oven and grill for 15 minutes or until the cheese has melted and is golden brown.

**Enjoy your healthy protein pizza! #CookItYourWhey #BulkBakes**
