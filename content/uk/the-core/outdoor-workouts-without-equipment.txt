The sun has finally arrived in the UK and it is the perfect time to be out and spending time in nature. Why not make the most of the summer months and take your training outside? An outdoor workout has the added benefit of spending time in nature. Gyms can be hot and busy, all the more reason to get outside in the fresh air. If lockdown has taught us anything, it has been to train effectively with minimal equipment. Read on for more on tips and example workouts you can take anywhere you go without needing any equipment with #TeamBulk ambassador and PT Sarah Lees.

When I am doing bodyweight/ minimal equipment training I like to keep my workouts ‘to time’. This helps keep the intensity high and my focus throughout. I recommend formats such as EMOM’s (every minute on the minute), AMRAPS (as many rounds as possible) and tabata (minutes on vs minutes rest).

Doing a workout to a timer holds you more accountable and gives the workout a great structure. Here is a full body EMOM workout suitable for all abilities.

Min 1: Burpee (6 reps beginner, 10 reps intermediate, 12 advanced)  
Min 2: Squat (14 reps beginner, 18 reps intermediate, 22 advanced)  
Min 3: Lunge (12 reps beginner, 14 reps intermediate, 16 advanced)  
Min 4: Toe Touch (12 reps beginner, 14 reps intermediate, 18 advanced)  
Min 5: Single Leg V-Up (10 reps beginner, 14 reps intermediate, 16 advanced)  
Min 6: Mountain Climber (max reps in 35s)

X 4 rounds = 24 minutes – perfect for an outdoor workout during lunch!

### Exercise 1: Burpee

A burpee works your full body and in this workout is your pulse raising exercise. A full burpee starts with your chest to the floor and finishes fully standing up with your hands clapping overhead. You can regress the burpee down to a ‘sprawl’. This removes the chest to floor element. It starts with a high plank and finishes with a clap overhead. Use this option if the floor isn’t suitable to lie on or if you are a beginner.

### Exercise 2 : Squat

A squat is a lower body exercise primarily targeting the quads and glute muscles. Start in a standing position and keep your chest up and shoulders back, lower down into the squat position. A full squat is achieved when your hips are at 90 degrees.

### Exercise 3 : Reverse Lunge

Lunges are another a lower body exercise that target the quads and hamstrings. Start with your feet shoulder width apart and step back with 1 leg. Imagine you are standing on train tracks (if your stance is too narrow this will make it hard to balance). The back knee should hover just above the floor before you push back up to your starting position.

### Exercise 4: Toe Touch

This is an upper body and core focused exercise. Start in a high plank position and engage your core. Reach your right hand to your left foot and push your hips up. Return back to a plank before repeating on the other side.

### Exercise 5: Single Leg V-Up

This is a core exercise. Start in a supine position on the floor. Lift your upper body off the floor and bring one leg in so they meet in the middle. Return back to your starting position and repeat with the other leg. Beginners can regress this movement down by having a bent leg and tucking their knee into their chest.

### Exercise 6: Mountain climber

The final exercise is a core focused pulse raiser. The aim is to go for as many reps as you can in 35 seconds. Try and have a consistent score across all 4 rounds (it’s not easy!). Start in a high plank position ensuring your shoulders are positioned above your wrists and your hips are low. Drive your knees into your chest one at a time as fast as you can, keeping your core tight.

### Product recommendations

I always supplement my workouts with the **bulk™** [Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-whey-isolate/bpb-cwhe). I love the fruity and refreshing taste and it is great iced cold. My favourite flavour is cherry bomb. It’s always important to recover properly to ensure you support your muscle repair. If it is a warm day, you might want to add in some electrolytes like the **bulk™** [Electrolyte Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/electrolyte-powder/bpb-elec-0000) as well as your post-workout protein shake.
