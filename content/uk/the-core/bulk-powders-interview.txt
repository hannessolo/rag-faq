In January we had the opportunity to film at BKK Fighters in Colchester with professional Thai fighter Stuart Barlegs. We spoke to Stuart about the demands of his training, the importance of nutrition to his success, and the use of [sports supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/) to aid his performance and recovery.

Stuart supplements this diet with a [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein.html), normally post-workout, to ensure he’s getting the fuel he needs to rebuild and recover after training. If you’re interested in Muay Thai, watch this video –  it is the first in a series of videos planned for 2013. Enjoy!
