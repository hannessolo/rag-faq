Cover all your nutritional bases with a smart approach to whole foods.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In an ideal world, our foods would give us all the vitamins and minerals we need. But the reality is different. Modern food processing has affected what we eat. So has soil quality, food miles and farming practices. Natural food these days isn’t quite what our grandparents were dishing up.

And then there’s the question of variety. Be honest, are you stuck in a rut of eating the same 5-10 fruits and veggies all year round? **[Multivitamins](../../health-wellbeing/multivitamins.html)** and [**Greens Powders**](../../health-wellbeing/greens-supplements.html) are a solid choice for supporting your general health. But don’t let them be an excuse. There’s plenty you can do to make your diet healthier.

### How To Get The Most Out Of Your Food

### Eat seasonal:

Nature knows what she’s doing. Follow nature’s lead by eating seasonal fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. Spring brings us leafy greens and early squash like courgettes. Summer abounds with brightly coloured fruits, vegetables, berries, and fresh seafood. Autumn is a good time for wild meat and game, and late summer vegetables. Winter gives us comforting carb sources like root vegetables, squash, and turkey of course!

### Eat local:

Supermarkets are convenient. But if you can buy even a small percentage of your food from local sources, you will boost the variety of micronutrients in your diet. Did you know that local honey is good for treating hay fever (because the bees have gathered pollen from local plants)?

### Buy local:

Wondering exactly how to buy food locally? Get into the habit of visiting farm shops and farmers markets, butchers and fishmongers. Your food will be fresher and more varied. And you’ll try things you would never pick up at the supermarket. Make friends with your butcher and he’ll tell you about cuts of meat, recipes, and cooking methods. Supermarket staff don’t do that!

### Grow your own:

Every bodybuilder should have an allotment and a few chickens (imagine the extra cardio!) Try growing your own herbs, veggies, berries, or potatoes in your garden. It’s easier than you think. Potatoes thrive in a grow-bag. The smallest window box can become a herb garden. An easier alternative is a daily serving of our **[Complete Greens™ tablets](../../complete-greens-tablets.html)**.

#### **Common Vitamin Deficiencies.**

Most of us are deficient in some vitamins and minerals. Recent mainstream news about [**Vitamin D**](../../vitamin-d3-tablets-5000iu.html) deficiency showed how widely recognised the problem is. But it’s doesn’t stop there. Diet and training can leave us lacking in **Vitamin B12**, **Vitamin K**, **Iron**, and **Magnesium**. It’s a good idea to take a quality, well-dosed multivitamin to cover your bases, like our [**Complete Vitamin Complex**](../../complete-multivitamin-complex.html)**™**.
