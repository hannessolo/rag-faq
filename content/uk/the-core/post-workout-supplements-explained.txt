If you’ve completed any type of physical activity and want to maximise your results, it’s probably worth looking at [post-workout](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/post-workout.html) nutrition. What you eat after training has an impact on what you’ll get out of your session. What’s the point in training really hard and only get some of the benefits? In this guide to post-workout supplements, we’ll show you how to get the most out of your workouts.

The Importance of Post-Workout Nutrition
----------------------------------------

If you’re aiming to increase muscle mass with your training, your physical activity has resulted in a breakdown of muscle fibres and the burning of fuel (glycogen). Integrating a post-workout shake as soon as you’ve finished training gives the muscles an immediate supply of important nutrients. Doing so with a standard meal wouldn’t have the same effect as you’d need time to prepare your food while your muscles are deprived of growth and repair nutrients for a longer period of time.

### How Post-Workout Supplements Can Help?

Post-workout and [recovery](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/recovery-techniques-fact-fancy/) supplements provide you with quality nutrition immediately after a workout. They can help you get stronger, increase muscle mass, improve performance and above all get the most out of your training session.

### Which are the best post-workout supplements?

In terms of what to eat after working out, the best post-workout supplement combo probably consists of protein, carbohydrates and amino acids. Here’s a breakdown of the fundamental nutrients that can support muscle fibres and some advice on what to eat after the gym.

*   **Whey protein**  
    Commonly known as a complete protein, pure whey protein contains essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) like leucine, isoleucine and valine which are the building blocks of muscle.
*   **BCAAs**  
    They’re considered essential amino acids in that they’re not produced by the body and need to be obtained through our diet as they make up for 1/3 of the protein within our muscles. [BCAAs](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids/bcaa) contribute to the muscle’s capacity to create protein so that fibres can grow and repair.
*   **Creatine  
    **It’s particularly popular with bodybuilders, powerlifters, rugby and football players. Basically, it’s for anyone performing successive bursts of short term, high-intensity exercise. It’s also very easy to mix it with other protein and/or carbohydrate drinks.
*   **Glutamine  
    **Another super-popular supplement, glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in muscle tissue. With intensive training, natural glutamine levels can lower, especially if you’re training as a bodybuilder. Integrating glutamine helps your body meet that demand.
