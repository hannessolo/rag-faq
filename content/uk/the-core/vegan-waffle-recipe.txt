[The Muscle Baker](https://themusclebakery.com/) is at it again, this time with a **Vegan Waffle Recipe**. If you haven’t tried our [Vegan Protein Blend](../../complete-vegan-blend.html)™ now is the perfect time to give it a go. Alternatively, if you’re not feeling the Vegan vibe, Micellar Casein can be used as a protein substitute. Happy days!

### Instructions:

1.) Mix milk and vinegar together and set aside.

2.) In a bowl mix together all your dry ingredients until combined. Then, fold in your wet ingredients until you get a thick batter.

3.) Heat up waffle machine as per instructions. If you have never made waffles before add less batter rather than more. _Add batter when green light goes off, then wait until green light goes off again to open waffle machine to remove waffle._

_4.) Note: If your waffle has a temperature setting, start at a lower heat then build it up._

5.) Repeat until all batter is used up.

6.) Pile them up on a plate, add your favourite [Zero Calorie Syrup](../../zero-calorie-syrup.html)™ and ENJOY!
