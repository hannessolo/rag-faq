We don’t think there is anything tastier than a chocolate cookie and to make these even tastier, they are TRIPLE CHOCOLATE and have tasty macros to fit!

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.) Preheat the oven to 160c and line a baking tray.

2.) In a mixing bowl, mix together all of the dry ingredients before stirring in the wet until you have a sticky, slightly more moist than a dough, consistency.

3.) Spoon the cookies into 8 tablespoon size mounds and then flatten and shape into a cookie!

4.) Pop in the oven for 12 minutes; they cook on after so don’t leave them in for too long!

5.) ENJOY!
