Elke, Head Chef at [The Muscle Bakery](https://themusclebakery.com/), has whipped up this **Vegan Satay Dip recipe** using our VitaFiber™ and Peanut Butter. It’s super-healthy and versatile too; you can add it as sauce to a meal, or simply use it as a dip for chicken or veggies. Enjoy!

### Instructions:

1.) Add water to a bowl and whisk in **VitaFiber**™ powder, then heat in microwave for 30 seconds.

2.) Whisk again and heat for a further 30 seconds.

3.) Fold in **Peanut Butter**, then add remainder of ingredient.

4.) Add to your simple meals to give it some flavour or use it as a dip with chicken skewers or veggies! Or you could always try with **Cashew Butter** instead! Yummy!

**Note:** if you prefer it thicker add more butter; if you prefer a runnier sauce then add less.
