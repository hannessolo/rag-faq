We’ve started the new year with a refreshed look and feel. That includes changing from Bulk Powders™, a name that has served us well, to **Bulk™**. We’ve opted for a new way of presenting our brand, products and community to simply showcase how progress is a journey at anyone’s reach. We want to champion and celebrate everyone’s efforts and commitment to be at their best.

Why we’ve rebranded
-------------------

2020 was an unpredictable year for everyone on the planet. For us, it also meant embarking on a huge transformation process. You may have noticed we look a little different now but, we haven’t forgotten where we came from. Always looking to be ahead of the game, we want to look as premium on the outside as our products are on the inside.

What changes we’ve made
-----------------------

Our products and values have stayed the same. The best ingredients, the best formulations, the best taste, the best choice, the best service and the best brand experience. You can now enjoy new and improved packaging design and materials, product categories and online experience as a part of the changes we’ve made – always with our customer community in mind.

Get to know the new Bulk™
-------------------------

We’re on a mission to empower every athlete and every person with the right nutrition to progress and reach their goals. Now more than ever we believe that sport, health, fitness and nutrition are for everyone – no matter who you are, what you do, or how you do it. 

Here’s what you can expect from this new and improved direction.

This is nutrition
-----------------

Starring Anthony Joshua and Katarina Johnson-Thompson, our campaign shot by the creative team La Familia takes you directly to the new Bulk™ world. Representing both serious athletes in training and more casual, health-conscious lifestyles, we wanted to highlight that nutrition is truly for everyone on a wellness journey.

New look
--------

Lettering artist Paul Hutchison of Hype Type in LA worked with creative agency Robot Foods to develop our new identity and bring clarity, symmetry and balance to the new wordmark.

The design concept is inspired by circular shapes to reflect progression, journey and inclusiveness while nodding to our original brand logo with a modern feel. 

The circular pattern is a returning element across all packaging and is reminiscent of nutritional charts. Differing between ranges, each pattern and colour are key to their pack expressions and create a cohesive experience across all categories.

With help from Ellen Luff Type Foundry, Robot Foods created the ‘Bulk Sans’ font suite: a common thread across the entire brand world.
