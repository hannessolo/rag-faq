Widely used and loved in the topical skin care industry, [Marine Collagen](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/marine-collagen-vitamin-c/bpb-mcol) has made its way over to the supplement market. With ongoing research into the benefits of marine collagen, it’s no wonder why.

[Collagen](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/collagen) is the most abundant protein in the human body, and the major building blocks in your skin, bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments and cartilage.

Research shows that our bodies’ natural collagen production slows as we age, which starts as early as your mid-20’s. This can lead to wrinkles, skin sagging and joint pain just to name a few.

Here in-house expert and nutritionist, [Lois Sharp,](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/authors/lois-sharp/) explains how marine collagen can help.

**What is Marine Collagen?** 
-----------------------------

Marine collagen is exactly as the name implies — it’s collagen derived from fish (specifically fish skin and scales).

Don’t fret, though. It’s not as bad as it sounds. Most [**Marine Collagen & Vitamin C Powder**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/marine-collagen-vitamin-c/bpb-mcol) is tasteless, but if you’re still not convinced, you can always get a flavoured powder instead.

Most collagen supplements contain ‘hydrolysed collagen’ — this is the good stuff. Hydrolysed just refers to the processing techniques used to obtain collagen peptides from the fish.

If the collagen is hydrolysed, it’s been broken down into peptides (smaller units of protein), thus making the collagen more absorbable.

**Marine collagen benefits**
----------------------------

### **May improve skin health**

Collagen is a major component of your skin and has been shown to play a role in strength, elasticity and skin hydration.

As your body produces less collagen as you age, this leads to wrinkles. Though this is a natural and normal process, studies have shown that a [collagen supplement can slow this process down](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9669612/#:~:text=The%20results%20showed%20that%20collagen,harm%20caused%20by%20immune%20depression.) and counteract the damaging effects of free radicals, as well as ‘[slow down the effects of skin ageing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7070905/)’. 

### **May improve joint and bone health**

Collagen is vital for the health of your muscles, bones and connective tissues. As your natural collagen production slows, people tend to experience more pain and stiffness in their joints.

Studies have shown that collagen supplementation can [decrease joint pain and stiffness](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30368550/#:~:text=After%20subgroup%20analysis%20of%20the,%2C%204.52%3B%20p%20%3D%200.81\)), but more research is needed in this area.

### **May boost muscle mass**

Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, making it an important part of skeletal muscle.

Collagen is a protein, and protein contributes to the growth and maintenance of muscle mass. This means collagen helps improve your macros, as well as your skin and nail health.

### **May improve hair and nail health**

While the mechanism of action is not yet established, some studies have shown that supplemental collagen has [increased nail growth and alleviates symptoms of brittle nails](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28786550/).

As well as this, collagen is a great source of amino acids, including proline, which is the main component of keratin which is thought to promote stronger hair.

### **May improve gut health**

The amino acids in collagen may help to strengthen the gut lining and reduce inflammation which has a knock-on effect to improving overall digestive health. However, more studies in this area are needed before a firm link can be established.

**Marine Collagen vs Bovine Collagen**
--------------------------------------

The main difference between marine collagen and bovine collagen is the animal they are sourced from. Marine collagen comes from fish, bovine collagen comes from cows. 

Due to their differing source, marine and bovine collagen contain different _types_ of collagen that lead to different benefits.

While marine collagen is made up totally of type 1 collagen, bovine collagen is a mix of type 1 and type 3 collagen. Depending on your reason for consuming collagen, this may affect which source of collagen you want to take.

Type 1 collagen mostly supports your skin, hair and bones, which is why marine collagen is typically what is found in more ‘beauty’ focussed products, whereas type 3 collagen (found in bovine collagen), supports your muscles, arteries and organs. 

This means that bovine collagen supports your skin, hair and bones as well as your muscles, arteries and organs due to the mix of type 1 and 3 collagen. 

**How much marine collagen per day to get the benefits?**
---------------------------------------------------------

There is a definite answer to how much marine collagen is recommended per day. The type of supplements and the amount you consume will totally depend on your age, weight and what you are trying to achieve from taking any specific supplement.

This makes it hard to define a set amount across the board, but some research suggests that a daily dose of **2.5g – 15g of marine collagen per day** is enough to experience the benefits. 

**How long does marine collagen take to work?**
-----------------------------------------------

Again, there is no set answer to this question. It depends on how much collagen you consume, how your body metabolises it, and your general lifestyle and diet.

Putting all of that aside, when studies are conducted to see the effects of marine collagen, they tend to be over a period of around 10-12 weeks.

**Where can I get marine collagen?**
------------------------------------
