BULK POWDERS™ athlete James DeGale knocked out Mexican Marco Antonio Periban in front of a packed Echo Arena in Liverpool on Saturday night. Periban, who has never been stopped before, had no answer to the speed, accuracy and power of James’ punches, and was dropped heavily in the 3rd round. James now goes on to fight for the IBF World Title in his next fight.

Prior to leaving for the fight, DeGale had exclusively told BULK POWDERS™ to “expect a performance.” It’s safe to say it was ‘Performance Delivered!’ From the opening bell, James looked far sharper than his opponent, regularly landing his jab from both the southpaw and orthodox stance. Periban struggled to connect with his punches as James moved in and out of range; James was looking in complete control. In the 3rd round a looping overhand left sent Periban crashing back to the ropes and on to the canvas. He bravely got up, but looked unsteady on his feet and the referee waved off the contest, ruling Periban was in no condition to continue.

James told BULK POWDERS™ “I felt fit, strong and in truth I was just warming up and getting into the fight. Periban has been in with world class fighters and never come close to being stopped – I think I’ve shown what I’m all about tonight.” BULK POWDERS™ asked James if he’s desperate to fight Carl Froch and he replied, “No. I’m desperate to fight for and win the world title and Carl just happens to have it. His indecision is holding me up. I’m 100% confident I’d beat Carl, but if he doesn’t want to fight me I’ll still be fighting for the world title – that’s what I want, to make history by becoming the first fighter to win an Olympic Gold Medal for Britain and a professional world title.”

James’ next fight will be for the IBF World Title – either against Carl Froch or, if Froch chooses to give up his title rather than face James, the next highest ranked opponent. Whoever James fights next, he will be supremely confident as 2014 has been a great year for him: 3 fights, 3 knock-outs. Alongside the Periban fight, James can take particular credit for the Brandon Gonzales fight in May. Gonzales came to Wembley a highly rated undefeated fighter, and was knocked out in the 4th round.

Congratulations James from everyone at BULK POWDERS™ – we’re all looking forward to an historic 2015!
