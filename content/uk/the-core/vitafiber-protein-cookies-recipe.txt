Some say that his bones are glued together with VitaFiber Powder and that if you look into his eyes, you’ll actually see protein bronuts rather than irides. All we know is, he’s called The Beltsander.

Get your apron on and bake up these delicious low calorie protein cookies with your favourite Bulk™ whey protein flavours and toppings.

### **Instructions**

1.) Add the VitaFiber™ Powder in a small pan on a low heat.  
2.) Add the 30ml water and start to whisk the mixture to combine.  
3.) Keep whisking until the mixture turns from cloud to a clear syrup.  
4.) Add your whey protein to a separate bowl.  
5.) Pour the syrup into the whey protein then quickly mix to combine into a rough dough.  
6.) Shape the dough into the shape required.  
7.) Add any additional toppings and bake at 180ºC for about 10 minutes.  
8.) Allow the cookies to cook before serving.
