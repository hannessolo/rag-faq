Christie, of [Christie’s lifestyle](http://www.christieslifestyle.co.uk/), received a baking bundle containing a selection of our [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™ flavours, as well as our popular and versatile [Liquid Egg Whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html). Christie worked her magic in the kitchen to make these incredible **Lemon Meringue Protein Cupcakes**.

Here’s how she made them…

### Method:

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees celcius and grease a muffin tin with a little bit of coconut oil on a tissue. Alternatively you can use paper cases as I have below.

Mix the protein powder and baking powder then add the egg whites and yoghurt. Mix well until you get a smooth consistency.

Spoon the batter into your muffin tins and bake for around 15 minutes until golden.

Top with protein meringues (recipe below)

For the meringues I simply whisked a cup of the [liquid egg whites](../../liquid-egg-whites.html)  with an electric whisk until they formed stiff peaks. I then folded in half a packet of the lemon meringue [protein powder sample](../../protein/protein-samples.html).

The mixture smelt delicious, I then popped a dollop of this onto a baking tray and put in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius for around half an hour until the mixture hardened into a meringue texture. I noticed that the meringues were tinted yellow, I think this is due to the protein powder. These were not like your conventional sugary meringue but tasted like a great alternative and went really well topped with the muffin and gave it that little bit of sweetness. You could even crumble the muffin and the meringue into a bowl of fat free yoghurt for a really tasty healthy treat.
