From baking banana bread to feta pasta and now to baked oats. The viral food trends circling recently have been seriously mouthwatering, but this latest one has really caught our eye. Oats are one of the most versatile breakfast ingredients. A healthy source of fibre and carbohydrates, they are a great addition to smoothies, soaked overnight with fruit toppings and now, our favourite – baked. Step up your breakfast with a baked oats recipe that gives the texture of a fresh baked cookie – crisp on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside. Perfect for those cool mornings, here is the Bulk Baked Oats recipe, courtesy of our ambassador, [Maëlys](https://www.instagram.com/maelys_lfe/).

Even better- it’s super simple, 100% vegan and 100% delicious.
