Waffles are generally a sweet treat, I love sweet waffles served with loads of berries and [nut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters.html), especially as a weekend brunch. But savoury waffles are just as delicious and should not be overlooked! They make a great base for a meal and are easy to make in advance then put in the fridge/freezer to reheat at a later date.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.) Turn on your waffle iron to get warmed up while you make the batter, grease the plates with a little coconut oil to stop the batter from sticking.

2.) In one bowl, mix together all of the dry ingredients. In another, mix all the wet ingredients and ensure they are both well combined.

3.) Gradually add the wet ingredients into the dry, mixing thoroughly as you go along.

4.) Carefully pour some of the mixture into the waffle iron, leaving a little room for expansion at the top – be careful not to overfill!

5.) Cook for about 5 minutes until golden brown all over then continue with the rest of the mix.

6.) Top with anything you fancy, I went for sausages and a poached egg and it was delicious!
