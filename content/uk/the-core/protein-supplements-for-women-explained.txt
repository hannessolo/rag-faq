Undoubtedly, there are many active women that could benefit from sports nutrition. Like men, women would benefit from a little extra protein to aid muscle repair and recovery – especially now as more women are hitting the gym, doing CrossFit, and weight lifting. Protein is a great addition to a diet that supports an active lifestyle and is suitable for women to use without getting the undesired side effects and results that people often think it produces.

**WHY DO WE NEED PROTEIN?**
---------------------------

Whether you’re trying to get in shape, aid recovery post-exercise or maintain a healthy weight, protein is a versatile supplement that can support a range of different fitness and lifestyle goals. If you struggle to consume enough protein from your regular diet, a protein shake is a convenient and affordable way to increase your intake of quality protein – with little-to-no fat or carbohydrate.

MYTHS ABOUT WOMEN AND PROTEIN
-----------------------------

### Myth 1: Consuming protein will make you look “bulky.”

One prevalent myth is that if women train and eat like men, they will develop a bulky physique. However, this notion is far from accurate. The misunderstanding stems from associating weight training and sports nutrition products primarily with men who aim to build muscle. What is often overlooked are the differences in training methods, calorie intake, and hormonal profiles between men and women.

It’s important to dispel this myth for a few reasons:

a) Building muscle mass is challenging, requiring a surplus of calories, adequate protein intake, a well-designed training plan that emphasises progressive overload, the presence of testosterone (for significant muscle growth), and a lot of patience.

b) Being “bulky” or having significant muscle mass as a woman should not be viewed negatively. Women should have the freedom to choose how they want to look without being judged for being muscular. Instead, we should empower women to pursue their desired physique, whether athletic and muscular or otherwise. The focus should be on educating people about the numerous benefits of protein and weight training, rather than solely on appearance.

### Myth 2: There are protein powders specifically tailored to women

Let’s be clear: protein powders claiming to be tailored for women are simply marketed to women. There is no inherent need for gender-specific protein powders, especially those that target women by using buzzwords like “weight loss” and “diet protein”, written on pink packaging.

Protein is protein, and it offers the same benefits regardless of the consumer’s gender. It’s comparable to marketing chicken and eggs exclusively to women – imagine that.

Realistically, an active female should be considering the same things as a man when choosing a protein powder:

*   Quality
*   Taste
*   Protein content
*   Essential amino acids profile
*   Whey protein or plant-based protein powder

None of the above is gender specific, therefore there is no real need for a female-specific brand.

One aspect that may differ for women is the recommended daily protein intake. On average, women weigh less than men, resulting in lower protein requirements. However, protein recommendations are primarily based on body weight and physical activity level, not gender.

**WHAT IS THE BEST PROTEIN POWDER?**
------------------------------------

The best protein powder depends on individual preferences and dietary needs. Here are some common types of protein powder and their benefits:

*   **Whey Protein Concentrate**  
    Derived from milk, whey concentrate contains varying levels of protein, along with small amounts of lactose and fat. It provides a good source of complete protein (complete amino acid profile) for muscle recovery and growth.
*   **Whey Protein Isolate**  
    Similar to whey concentrate, whey isolate is also derived from milk. However, it undergoes additional processing to remove most of the lactose and fat, resulting in a higher protein content per serving and quicker absorption rates.
*   **Hydrolysed Whey Protein**  
    This form of whey protein undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis, breaking down the protein into smaller peptides for easier digestion and absorption.
*   **Casein Protein**  
    Derived from milk, casein protein is a slow-digesting protein, resulting in a sustained release of amino acids. It is commonly used before bed or during prolonged periods without protein intake to support muscle recovery and prevent muscle breakdown.
*   **Plant-Based Protein Powders**  
    There are various types of plant-based protein powders, including soy, pea, rice, and hemp protein. These options are suitable for vegans and individuals with lactose intolerance or dairy allergies.

Protein Powders for Women: FAQs
-------------------------------

### Is protein powder good for females?

Yes, a protein powder can be beneficial for anyone who wants to conveniently increase their daily protein intake, including women.

### Can protein powder good help me lose weight?

Protein powder does not directly affect body weight. To lose weight, a calorie deficit is necessary, meaning you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. However, protein powders can be helpful supplements to support weight loss efforts as they may help you feel fuller for longer and support overall nutrition goals.

### Should older women use protein powder?

Like every other population, older women do not have to supplement with protein powders. Protein powders are simply supplements to an already healthy diet, which can help conveniently increase daily protein intake. However, older women do need to be a bit more mindful of their daily protein intake, as it can help keep bones and muscles strong and minimise the density loss that comes with ageing.

### How can I increase my protein intake?

While a protein supplement is a great way to conveniently increase daily protein intake, it’s always best to take a food-first approach and aim to consume the majority of your daily protein from real food. Here are some tips:

*   Include a protein source in each meal, such as lean meat or fish
*   Snack on protein-rich foods, such as beef jerky or Greek yoghurt
*   Add plant-based proteins into meals, such as beans, legumes, and chia seeds

### How much protein do I need a day?

For active individuals, it’s recommended to consume around 1g of protein per kg of body weight per day. Those who are more physically active, have a desire to increase muscle mass, or strength train regularly would require a higher protein intake.
