We were dazzled by Lindsay from Lean Bean Nutrition when she caused a stir with this [Key Lime Pie Protein Cheesecake recipe](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/protein-key-lime-pie-recipe/). Sheâ€™s now back with a slightly different recipe for a gorgeous summery Zesty Berry flavour. Mary Berry would be proud. Give it a bash.

### **Instructions**

#### Base

1.) Place all the ingredients in a bowl  
2.) Add boiling water (enough to cover the surface of the ingredients) and leave to soften  
3.) Blend and press into a cookie cutter

#### Middle

1.) Mix together the Greek yoghurt and [protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein.html)  
2.) Pour on top of the cheesecake base  
3.) Blend the berries and mix into the cheesecake filling (leave a little)  
4.) Using the spare blended berries, pour into cookie cutters (or an ice cube tray) and freeze to form sorbet  
5.) Place the cheesecake and blended berries in the freezer for 2 hours
