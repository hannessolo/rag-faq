Jon, of [JonWalker.fit](http://www.jonwalker.fit/), received a selection of ingredients from our [sports nutrition](../../sports-nutrition.html) and [Active Foods](../../shop-by-range/active-foods.html)™ range, including a variety of Pure Whey Protein™ flavours, some Liquid Egg Whites and a popular recipe staple, VitaFiber™ powder.

Tasked with creating something that was packed with protein, healthy and tasty all at the same time, Jon opted for a powerful dessert. Intent on raising his ‘baking game’, he decided to bake ‘the cheesecake to end all cheesecakes’, thus creating something that was uber tasty, but wouldn’t undone all your hard work in the gym…

In the end, he concocted the longest recipe name in the history of the world…the **Protein Strawberry, White Chocolate & Coconut Cheesecake Recipe**.

Here’s how he made it…

### Method:

**The Base**

1.) Combine the ground almonds, almond butter and sweet freedom with your fingers until the contents stick together.

2.) Place this into a round cake tin (I use a 20cm) and press down with your fingers.

**The Filling**

1.) Combine all of the filling ingredients into your food blender and blend until the mixture is smooth. You can also use a whisk to do this, but I prefer to use the blender.

2.) Pour the filling on top of the almond biscuit base in your cake tin.

3.) Cook in the oven for around 40 minutes at 160 degrees, you want the cake to still “wobble” in order to resemble a cheesecake.

**Topping**  
1.) Add the fruit spread/jam to the top of your cake and then add dessicated coconut on top and place in a container in your fridge until the next day (don’t give into temptation!)
