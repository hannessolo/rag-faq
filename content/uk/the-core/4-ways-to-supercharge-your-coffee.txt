If you’re anything like us, you love a good cup of coffee. First thing in the morning, as a pre-workout fix, or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, coffee is always there when you need it most.

As admirers of the magnificent bean, we decided to get a little creative, challenging our product team to ‘pimp up’ a regular cup of Joe, to create a new breed of Supercharged coffee.

Using a selection of our supplements, they have achieved just that, producing 4 variations of coffee that each deliver a myriad of benefits.

Here’s what they created:

The Fat Fighter
---------------

_It does what it says on the tin. The addition of two ingredients, Green Coffee Extract and Cinnamon Extract, not only adds a flavour twist but also helps to control blood sugar levels – which in turn helps to reduce hunger and appetite. If you need a shot of coffee, but you’re watching your waistline, give this a try!_

The science

Green Coffee Extract 400mg – green coffee extract contains a higher % of Chlorogenic acid. Our Green Coffee Extract contains a huge 50% Chlorogenic Acid. It has long been associated with weight loss and is often included in fat loss products.

Cinnamon Extract 400mg – cinnamon extract not only provides a nice cinnamon flavour to the coffee, it also helps to control blood sugar levels. This in turn will help to control hunger and appetite, preventing you from overeating.

What you’ll need

1 cup of coffee

Cinnamon Extract 400mg

The Jetpack
-----------

_This is the go-to when a simple coffee just isn’t enough. This is coffee with a jetpack – the sort of jetpack that includes Guarana (providing an extra, natural source of caffeine) and L-Tyrosine, to give your neurotransmitters a bit of a nudge. Down a cup of this for improved mood and focus._

The science

Guarana 400mg (the contents of one capsule) – guarana helps to provide an additional, natural source of caffeine to the mix, really supercharging your coffee.

L-Tyrosine 1g – tyrosine has been associated with the release of neurotransmitters which will help to improve focus. Tyrosine has also been associated with improving general mood.

What you’ll need

1 cup coffee

Guarana 400mg (the contents of one capsule)

[L-Tyrosine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/tyrosine/bpb-ltyr-0000) 1g

[Zero Calorie Syrup](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/zero-calorie-syrup/bpf-zcsy) – a flavour of your choice.

The Bedtime Brew
----------------

_Reach for the decaf, you’ve pulled! It’s time to hop into bed with this cup of warm z. This is ultimate relaxation in a mug. The additions of Glycine, L-Theanine and L-Tryptophan will ‘almost certainly’ guarantee you an amazing night of slumber. Make a Bedtime Brew, relax, and drift off to the Land of Bedtime Gains._

The Science

Glycine 2g – glycine is associated with improving your sleep quality, which makes it an ideal amino acid to consume pre-bed. Glycine also works as a sugar-free sweetener.

L-Theanine 200mg – Theanine is often used to improve your ability to relax and put you in a state of calm – ideal pre-bed.

L-Tryptophan 500mg – Tryptophan is converted to serotonin in the body which is often referred to as the “sleep hormone”

What you’ll need

1 cup decaf coffee

[Glycine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/glycine/bpb-lgly-0000) 2g

L-Theanine 200mg

[L-Tryptophan](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/tryptophan/bpb-ltry-0000) 500mg

The Energiser
-------------

_This is just the ticket when you need some ‘oomph’ to get you moving. But it doesn’t stop there, The Energiser will keep you fired up for hours, due to the addition of Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (thanks MCTs!) and Cacao Liquor Buttons. Not only does this amplify the flavour, but it also boosts vitamin and mineral content too. It’s best to whack this one in a blender for optimum results!_

The Science:

1 tsp Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil – a great source of fats and more specifically Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs).

3-5 Cacao Liquor Buttons – Cacao Liquor Buttons are also a great source of fats to provide you with a source of energy and suppress appetite. As well as giving the coffee with additional flavour, it also boosts the vitamin and mineral content.

What you’ll need

1 cup coffee

1 tsp [Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/organic-virgin-coconut-oil/bpf-ovco)

3-5 [Cacao Liquor Buttons](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods)

Each of these creations can be flavoured/sweetened to taste using ingredients such as:

*   Milk (or milk alternative)
*   [Stevia](../../stevia-extract-powder.html)
*   Zero Calorie Syrup
*   [LiquiFlav™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/liquiflav/bp-liqu-50ml)

And there you have it – 4 supercharged coffees that are destined to change the world as you know it! Why not give these a try yourself, or better still, why not create your own supercharged coffee and share it tagging #TeamBulk?
