The sun has finally decided to make its appearance, so why not get ready for summer and cool off with this refreshing Apple & Lime BCAA Sorbet.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.) Add apples, milk and BCAA’s to a blender and blitz. If your blender is of high quality you wont have a problem, however if you have a lower quality blender just keep scraping the mix into the centre and shaking it about to ensure it all blends together nicely.

2.) Pour into a tupperware or bowl, mix in crushed raspberries and place in freezer.

(Now the hard part)

3.) Keep stirring it every 30-45 mins to achieve a creamy consistency rather than a frozen block of sorbet. Repeat several times until you are able to more or less scoop it out with an ice-cream scoop.

Note: texture will be slightly crumblier than actual sorbet due to the minimal ingredients used.
