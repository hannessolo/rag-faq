They say you are what you eat. When it comes to nutrition and performance – we all know how important it is to have a balanced diet. To get some recipe inspiration and to see how a champion fuels their body for success we went straight to the top. That means none other than the two-time world heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua.

It can be difficult with our busy lifestyles to prioritise good nutrition with every meal. However, a balanced diet is crucial to our overall health and well-being. The healthier you are, the better you can support your body. With that being said, we invite you to step inside AJ’s kitchen to discover its favourite post-workout routine with Bulk. That comes down to recovery, mindset and a healthy meal packed with the essentials. Here’s a quick, easy and healthy post-workout snack idea using Bulk Oat Drink, [Informed Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/informed-whey/bpps-iwhe), [Dried Goji Berries](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dried-goji-berries/bpf-goji) and [Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut), all mixed in one bowl for a heavenly result.
