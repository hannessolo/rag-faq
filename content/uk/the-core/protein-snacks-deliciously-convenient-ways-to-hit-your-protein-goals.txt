Even if you’re a master at meal prep, snacks can leave you lost. Don’t second-guess snack-time – we’ve done the hard work for you!

Why Choose Ready-Made Protein Snacks?
-------------------------------------

Let’s face it, most commercial snacks that you can grab on the go are high in carbs and woefully short on protein. They’re often sugary, too high in fat, and who really knows the quality of the ingredients? Even the new wave of raw/Paleo/clean eating type snacks are usually heavy on the fats with very little protein.

Of course, you could make your own protein snacks. We have a ton of protein baking recipes on [The Core™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/). Or you could pack a few hard boiled eggs or a tin of sardines in your bag. But if you don’t have time to bake, and you don’t want to be the unpopular person always stinking out the office, take a look at these options.

We know there are a lot of [protein snacks](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/protein-snacks.html) on the market, but we are really proud of the quality and simplicity (not to mention the cost!) of ours. Have a look through and see how they measure up.

High Protein Sweet Treats
-------------------------

First up, our popular [snack bars](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-protein-snack-bars-box-of-12.html). They come in three truly delicious flavours and have 27g protein from whey and milk protein. They are low carb and low calorie but really satisfying. If you want a higher carb bar, go for our [high protein flapjacks](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-protein-flapjack.html) which have 21g protein each and are high in fibre too.

We also have a [Vegan protein bar](https://www.bulk.com/uk/gourmet-vegan-bar.html), which is free from gluten and dairy and 100% vegan (with 21g protein per bar from pea and brown rice protein).

Our [high protein cookies](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-protein-cookies.html) are big, soft, and have that just-baked texture but they are infinitely better for you than a real cookie. And they really do taste amazing (that’s why we wrap them individually!) Both of the flavour varieties have over 27g per soft-baked cookie. Ideal for your coffee break.

How about our [Chocolate Whey Balls™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chocolate-whey-balls.html)? Don’t blame us if you get addicted! These milk, dark, or which chocolate balls are whey protein covered in real chocolate. But unlike a popular spherical chocolate snack ball, these have 20.5g protein per 100g!

Or you might like our [Chocolate Protein Bites™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chocolate-protein-bites.html) which are crunchy chunks of milk or which chocolate with whey protein crisps inside, just like your favourite childhood baking snack but much better for you!

Protein Baking
--------------

If you fancy baking, our protein baking mixes make it easy to whip up Chia Seed Muffins, [Protein Pancakes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein-pancake-mix.html) or [Cacao Protein Brownies](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cacao-protein-brownie-mix.html). Everything is so easy to make and bake, you don’t need any fancy kitchen equipment.

Beef Jerky & Biltong
--------------------

Not all protein snacks have to be sweet! If you have more of a savoury tooth, or just fancy a detour from cookies and bars, then try our [jerky](https://www.bulk.com/uk/beef-jerky.html) or [biltong](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-protein-biltong.html). The protein content of this dried meat snack is unreal, and its chewy consistency means you need to take your time (perfect for hungry snackers!). The beef jerky is made with topside beef, and the biltong is made with silverside beef. It doesn’t smell and it’s not messy, so you can eat it on the go or at your desk.

Nuts & Seeds
------------

If you’re a [nuts and seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nuts-seeds.html) fan, don’t forget you can stock up on [whole almonds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/whole-almonds.html), [chia seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chia-seeds.html), and [sunflower seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sunflower-seeds.html). Or you might prefer to dive into our extensive [nut and seed butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/4-seed-peanut-butter.html) range.

Peanut Butter
-------------

Our natural [peanut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/peanut-butter.html) is as pure as it gets, containing just roasted peanuts. No oil, salt, or any nasties. It’s a high fat, high protein snack option that’s perfect for keeping in the kitchen at work or in the cupboard at home. Eat it on rice cakes, in a smoothie, or just off the spoon… the opportunities are endless!

Protein Mug Cakes
-----------------

There are loads of delicious protein mug cake recipes on The Core™ but we’ve made it even easier with our [protein mug cake mix](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein-mug-cake-mix.html) – 24g per serving and ready in less than a minute! Your taste buds will think it’s a cake, but your body will know it’s much healthier!

Never go hungry at snack time again!
