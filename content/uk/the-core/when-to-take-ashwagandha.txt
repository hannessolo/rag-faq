**What is ashwagandha?**
------------------------

Ashwagandha is a herb from Southeast Asia. Extracts or powders from the ashwagandha plant’s roots or leaves have long been used in alternative medicine for a [wide range of purposes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/).

It is considered an adaptogen, meaning it’s purported to enhance the body’s resilience to stress and help our body cope better with the physical effects of stress. It is also taken to support the onset of sleep.

[![what is ashwagandha](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1609-16-ashwaganda-533x355.jpg)](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/what-is-ashwagandha/)

**When is the best time to take ashwagandha?**
----------------------------------------------

Ashwagandha can be consumed at any time of the day. Some people find that taking it in the morning helps them start their day, while others prefer to take it in the evening before bed. As mentioned above, it supports the onset of sleep.

Focus on finding a time where you can do it constantly, whether it’s taken as part of your morning routine or as you settle down for doing your morning routine. 

“The best time to take ashwagandha would be at a time that you remember to take it consistently”, says Roberts. “Some people prefer to take it in the morning to help start their day with a calm, clear mind, while others prefer to take it before bedtime to help them relax before sleep.”

**Should you take ashwagandha in the morning or at night?**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Ashwagandha can be taken in the morning, at night, or at any other time of the day. Timing will mostly depend on your personal preferences, tolerance, and the type of ashwagandha you choose to take. Much like a supplement like creatine, it doesn’t matter when you take it – just do it every day.

“Ashwagandha timing also depends on your specific supplement stack and your purpose of taking it. If you want to stack ashwagandha with the likes of melatonin to aid sleep, it would be beneficial to take before bedtime. Ashwagandha supports the onset of sleep.

On the other hand, if you want to stack it with [multivitamins](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/multivitamins), [probiotics](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/probiotics), and [fish oils](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/fish-oils) to help kickstart your day, you may consider taking it in the morning”, says Abi.

**When to take ashwagandha for sleep**
--------------------------------------

There’s no set dosage for this herb and different experts suggest different things, so it’s important to consult with your doctor or another medical professional before consuming any new herbs or supplements for sleep, including ashwagandha.

“Generally, it would make the most sense to take ashwagandha around an hour before bedtime to give it some time to absorb to feel any possible immediate relaxing effect. 

But the longer-term benefits of ashwagandha may take much longer to notice. It depends on the supplement, dosage, and how your body responds”, says Abi.

“KSM-66 is more potent as it’s a specialised root extract that closely resembles the natural ratios of bioactive constituents of the Ashwagandha root. It’s also produced more safely and cleaner, produced without using chemicals, better for the environment. 

KSM-66 is also the most clinically studied ashwagandha extract. Extracts are taken from the root, not the leaves.” 

**Summary: When to take ashwagandha**
-------------------------------------

Since ashwagandha takes time to work, take at a time you can stick to. You may wish to take it with food or at night if you notice any stomach discomfort. 

All in all, the best time to take ashwagandha is when you can be consistent in taking it. This could be in the morning after breakfast, after lunch in the day, or just before bed at night.
