Essential amino acids (EAA’s) are growing in popularity and there’s a clear reason why. If you’re ready to take your workouts to the next level, read on for everything you need to know about EAA’s.

**What are EAAs?**
------------------

Everyone says that amino acids are the building blocks of protein. What does that mean exactly?  Protein is made up of long chains of amino acids that are folded in a particular way. They play both structural and non-structural roles within the body. Whether forming muscle and connective tissue, cell signalling, cognitive activity or supporting your immunity, protein is extremely important to our overall health.

There are 20 different amino acids, 11 of which the body can produce itself. The other 9 are known as Essential Amino Acids because they must be obtained through the diet. This is where our **[Essential Amino Acid](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/essential-amino-acids/bpb-eaa-0000)** powder comes into play. With an _exclusive_ blend of all 9 EAAs, it’s a great way to ensure you’re getting all of the EAA’s your body needs. Some people believe that having a blend of all 9 essential amino acids is more beneficial to supporting muscle building than blends using only a few, selected EAA’s.

While EAA’s can be consumed any time of day, they are most often used pre or intra workout. This is to ensure they’re available for the body to utilise when it needs them most.

The 9 essential amino acids are: Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Methionine, Histidine, Lysine, Tryptophan, Phenylalanine and Threonine. All of which play a specific role in the body, whilst also working in synergy with one another.

**Why should you take EAAs?**
-----------------------------

You might be thinking, if all proteins are made up of amino acids, you must already be getting enough through food sources? If you have a balanced diet, then yes. You may likely be consuming a decent amount of essential amino acids, however, there is always room for improvement. 

An additional source of EAAs may support you for a number of reasons. These reasons include but are not limited to:

### **You follow a vegan diet**

Protein rich foods such as lean poultry, eggs and dairy products are not vegan friendly. In some cases, following a vegan diet may not provide you with enough EAAs day to day

### **You regularly workout**

Whether you are working out to building muscle or lose weight, EAAs are a great choice to maximise your potential during a workout. They do not count towards your daily caloric intake, so are the perfect solution to push you to reach your goals.

### **You intermittent fast**

EAAs are a great supplement to consider if you enjoy working out in a fasted state. They are the perfect supplement when trying to avoid muscle loss during a fasted workout. This is because they simultaneously fuel muscles for the workout and contributing to muscle building.
