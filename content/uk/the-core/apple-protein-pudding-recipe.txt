### Summary

Add a festive twist to some oats and create your own granola style Apple Protein Pudding, incorporating a scoop of our [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html "Pure Whey Protein")™ (apple crumble flavour). This recipe packs over 35g of protein and 43g of slow-release carbs to keep you fueled while you unwrap all your presents…

### Instructions

**To make the granola:**

1.) Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

2.) Mix your ingredients and spread evenly onto a baking tray (lined with greaseproof baking paper) and bake at high heat, moving it around constantly so that it bakes evenly. Remove from oven when done and leave to cool.

3.) Divide into 4 portions. You will need only 1/2 portion for the pudding, the rest will keep fine in sandwich bags.

**For your pudding:**

1.) Add your apple sauce to a saucepan and heat up to simmering point.

2.) Once it has, whisk in your gelatin until dissolved. Remove from heat and whisk in your whey.

3.) Pour into a bowl and leave to set overnight in the fridge (or at least 4-5 hours)

4.) When set, add your yoghurt and top with the ½ portion of granola.

You can enjoy this treat hot or cold, we had it cold, but pop in the microwave for a couple of minutes for a warm, crumbly, apple protein breakfast.
