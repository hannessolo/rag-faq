What is Calisthenics?
---------------------

Calisthenics is the science, art or practice of bodyweight exercises for the purpose of improved strength, fitness and flexibility, through movements such as bending, jumping, swinging, twisting or kicking.

Watch this video of Frank Medrano, considered one of the world’s most respected Calisthenics experts. Next time you’re on holiday or at the gym, and all the equipment is being used, adopt the ‘Medrano’ approach. Use bodyweight exercises, or restricted equipment workouts to your advantage. Not only will Calisthenics deliver an insane core workout, it will engage your muscles and push your muscular endurance to the max too.

At the end of it all, when your body is crying out for some help, refuel with a [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™ or an all-in-one like [AFTERMATH](../../aftermath.html)™.
