**_Wouldn’t it be great to catch the eye of a guy who appreciates your efforts in the gym? Here’s how to attract the gym hottie (and avoid the others!)_**

Fit women like you already know the benefits of weight training: a leaner, tighter body, more confidence (in and out of the gym), and the ability to throw on pretty much any outfit and make it look great. And most of the time, you hit the gym for yourself. What blokes may or may not think of you, really doesn’t matter.

But you know what, sometimes it does matter… Valentine’s Day being one of them. Let’s face it, we’d all like a hot date for V-Day and – when you’re a girl who lifts – you want a date who lifts, too.

So how should a gym-going girl go about attracting the attention of the right guy in the gym, without catching the eye of “that guy” (you know, the weird one who stares at you when you’re on the leg press and tries to talk to you when you’re between sets)? We’ve got you covered:

### Be Confident.

You love training, so know that it gives you far more than a hot bod. Men are attracted to women who train hard because it shows you’re strong, fit, athletic, outgoing and passionate about what’s important to you.

### Ask for a spot.

Ideally when it’s leg day. Most guys will be only too happy to help, and you’ll instantly be able to tell whether there’s any chemistry (and how seriously he takes his levels of personal hygiene). Spark not there? You’ve got the perfect get-out: just thank him, and say you’ve got the next rep.

### Don’t be ‘that girl’.

Don’t be the girl who flirts and giggles more than she trains. If your guy is serious about his physique, he’ll be serious about his training too. Make eye contact and see if he returns a smile, and then choose your moments wisely for a little bit of banter. Don’t interrupt his set, and remember the International Language of Headphones.

### Use the mirrors.

They can be a great way to check out the “scenery”, but guys can get wise to it. Don’t be too obvious, and concentrate on your own workout first (you can sneak a little peek during rest periods).

### Balance.

Gym guys tend to like girls with muscle, but the age-old balance of the sexes still holds true. So there’s nothing wrong with acting a little girlie if your crush asks you if you want help putting your weights away, or offers to unload your bar. It could be just the ice-breaker you need. You can show him how strong you are later.

### Attract the right kind of attention.

Attract the right kind of attention. Don’t turn up to train hamstrings in booty shorts, or rock up with a full face of make up (unless you’ve come straight from a meeting). Leave the perfume for the first date. Just be real, natural, and normal. Training hard will attract the kind of attention you want, from the guys you like.

Still not sure your guy is single? Here’s a failsafe tip: go to the gym on Valentine’s Day evening. If he’s there… and you are too… what more do you need to know? The only question now is who will make the first move?
