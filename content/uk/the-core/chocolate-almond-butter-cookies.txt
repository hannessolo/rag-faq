Our baking diva, Hebe, has concocted these little gems. ‘Almost-everything-free’ Chocolate Almond Butter Cookies. Using our Beef Protein Isolate, Liquid Egg Whites and our immense Almond Butter, these cookie treats are gluten, dairy and soy free, and taste incredible. Watching your carbs? With less than 1g of carbs per cookie, these are a macro-watcher’s dream.

### Instructions

1) Preheat the oven to 175C.

2) In a bowl, mix together the almond butter, [HydroBEEF](../../beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef.html "HydroBEEF")™, cocoa and Natvia. Add the egg white and mix really well. Divide into 6 equal parts, shape into balls and press flat between your hands. It’s meant to be quite oily!

3) Place on a lined baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes or until crispy around the outside.
