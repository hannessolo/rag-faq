When the Muscle Baker isn’t covering objects and people in little stickers, she is busy in the kitchen making food taste like rainbows. She’s up to her old tricks again, this time making a Raspberry Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake using a handful of our products, including Pure Whey Protein, Liquid Egg Whites and Peanut Butter.

**Instructions:**

1.) Pre heat oven to 180 degrees.

2.) Mix the base ingredients together and press into the bottom of a spring form pan and bake for 5 minutes.

3.) Then, mix the filling ingredients together except for the Choc Shot and pour over the base. Finish off with choc shot drizzle, using the tip of a knife to create swirls.

4.) Bake for approximately 20-25 minutes, until cheesecake is baked but remains slightly wobbly (not a lot). This will set in the fridge.

5.) Leave to set in fridge for a couple of hours (if patient enough)

Cuts 12 slices.
