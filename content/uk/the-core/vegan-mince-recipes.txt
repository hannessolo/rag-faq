Whisk in a little of the milk at a time, stirring continuously until you have a smooth, slightly thick sauce. Remove from the heat, and season with salt and pepper.

Grease a baking dish with butter or oil. Spoon a layer of Bolognese sauce over the bottom of the dish. Top the first layer with lasagne sheets, then another layer of Bolognese sauce. Repeat until you have used up all of the sauce and lasagne. Cover the top Bolognese layer with béchamel sauce.

Bake in a preheated oven at 200C/180C Fan for 30 minutes or until golden on top and the pasta is cooked through.

**Vegan mince burger**
----------------------

### **Ingredients** 

1 onion finely diced  
1 tsp olive oil  
1 clove garlic finely diced  
1 small red chilli finely diced (optional)  
300g Vegan Pea Protein Mince  
75g wholemeal breadcrumbs  
2 medium sized eggs beaten  
½ teaspoon mild chilli powder optional  
2 tablespoon chopped coriander  
Salt and pepper  
1 tablespoon plain flour  
1 tablespoon olive oil  
Burger buns with iceberg Lettuce, slices of tomatoes and cucumber to serve

### **Method**

Heat the olive oil over a medium heat in a large frying pan. Add the onion, garlic and chilli and gently sauté together, stirring continuously to avoid burning for three to four minutes.

Add the vegan mince and stir everything together for about five minutes until the mince mixture is quite wet, then remove the pan from the heat to allow the mixture to cool a little to be able to be handled.

In a mixing bowl combine the mince mixture, breadcrumbs, beaten eggs, chilli powder, chopped coriander and season with a little salt and pepper.

Using your hands, form the mixture into four burger patties, coat very lightly with the plain flour and rest, covered in the fridge for at least 20 minutes. Heat the tbsp. olive oil in the frying pan, and gently cook the burgers on each side until lightly browned.

Serve the burgers in the burger buns, on top of the iceberg lettuce and slices of cucumber, topped with slices of tomato. You won’t find a better vegan mince burger recipe.
