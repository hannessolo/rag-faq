With summer approaching and holidays booked, all of a sudden we’re inundated with questions on body composition. For some, panic is setting in at the thought of wobbling along the beach with a beer gut or muffin top. If you’re honest with yourself, you should be dedicated all year round, regardless of any holidays abroad. Why not change your body for good and not only impress on your 2 week holiday, but every day of your life!

One very common question we get asked is, ‘How can I lose fat but also build muscle?’ With this in mind we have gone through our vast supplement range and based this informative and inspiring blog post around them.

Supplements of Choice
---------------------

### Protein

No stack is complete without protein. Try to consume 2g per kg of bodyweight to reap the numerous benefits, such as fat loss, strength gains and maintaining/building lean mass. Try [Pure Whey Isolate™ 90](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-category/protein-supplements/whey-protein/pure-whey-isolate-90.html "Pure Whey Isolate™ 90") or [Beef Protein Isolate 97 (HYDROBEEF™)](https://www.bulk.com/uk/beef-protein-isolate-97-hydrobeef.html "Beef Protein Isolate") to ensure maximum protein is absorbed with minimum carbs and fat, to help with staying lean. Alternatively vegetarians/vegans should try [Super Pea Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-category/protein-supplements/vegan-protein/super-pea-protein-isolate.html "Pea Protein Isolate") with it being 80% protein content and highly soluble.

### Bulk

Increasing size is definitely one of the most popular goals amongst our customers. Big isn’t big enough so the use of supplement can simply take you to the next level. Try [Complete Lean Mass™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-lean-mass-gainer.html "Lean Mass protein shake") for additional, clean calories without quite as much carbohydrates as a standard mass gainer protein powder. Or why not DIY, and opt for single ingredients such as clean carbohydrates from [Ultra-Fine Scottish Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html "Powdered Instant Oats") along with a [Creatine supplement](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine.html "Creatine") and [HMB Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/hmb-powder-2.html "HMB Powder") stack for muscle and strength gains.

### Burn

Burning excess fat can be extremely difficult, especially if you want to shift those final few pounds. The key really is diet, however supplementing with Pro Series™ [Cutting Edge™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cutting-edge.html "Cutting Edge™") or [Green Coffee & Raspberry Ketones tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/raspberry-ketones-green-coffee-tablets-200mg.html "Green Coffee & Raspberry Ketones tablets 550mg") along with [CLA Softgels 1000mg](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cla-conjugated-linoleic-acid-softgels.html "CLA softgels 1000mg") (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) is a perfect combo to help burn fat as well as improve overall body composition. Alternatively try the [Beach Body Bundle](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-category/stacks-bundles/beach-body-bundle.html "Beach Body Bundle") for a simple ready-made stack.

It’s not a quick fix, it’s a permanent change!
----------------------------------------------

Achieving this ‘ideal’ body shape is not going to be easy, and it is subject to a whole host of different factors only you can change; not a magic pill or powder. Reality is that Your New Body is going to be very hard without the correct nutrition; eat clean and healthy and steer clear of trans fats and high sugar products. For weight gain simply eat an extra 500+ Kcal or, to lose weight, look at a 500 Kcal deficit. Remember to gain mass you must eat! It is easier to lose fat whilst you are already big, instead of gaining mass and losing fat at the same time.

One final point to make is to remember **resistance exercise** is vital to help shape and tone your body, as well as increasing strength and ultimately size. Stay basic and monitor your progress. If you’re trying to lose fat then cardio is fine but don’t overdo it to avoid having a catabolic effect (muscle wasting).
