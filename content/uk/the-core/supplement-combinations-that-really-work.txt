It’s the ultimate conundrum. Is it better to buy single supplements and create your own stacks specific to your goals and training, or should you choose a formulation, like an all-in-one, that may or may not include the ingredients combinations you need?

Let’s find out.

### **What are the pros to do-it-yourself formulation?**

If you decide to put on your science coat and create your own supplement cocktail, you have more freedom to get creative – provided you know what you’re doing. You can cherry pick exactly what you need and experiment with different dosages to determine what works best for you. If your goals change, as they often do, you have the added flexibility of being able to adapt what combinations you are using.

### **What are the cons?**

The downside is you might not necessarily choose the best combinations, which could impact both your performance and your wallet. Getting the dosage right is also important. Our formulations, and the dosages of ingredients in them, are all research-lead. Altering the amount of these could directly influence how effective they are. If in doubt, stick to a formulation like AFTERMATH. Experiment with your supplementation only when you have the knowledge and the confidence to do so.

### **Remove an element of risk.**

But there are things you can do to remove the element of risk. Below is a list of supplement combinations that really work. They are perfect synergists – working together to create the ideal physiological environment in which to prosper. Adding these supplements to your stack, in these combinations, will almost guarantee you see the benefits you want – provided you work hard too of course!

### **Supplement Combinations for Physical Performance.**

*   [Creatine Monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine)
*   [Beta Alanine](../../beta-alanine.html)

Creatine Monohydrate supplementation has been scientifically proven to increase physical performance in high intensity exercise, by increasing the muscle phosphocreatine stores and increasing the breakdown of ATP for energy. Beta Alanine, when combined with histidine in the muscle cells, will provide the neutralised environment for the Creatine to work in at these high intensities – two fantastic ingredients that really do go hand-in-hand.

### **Supplement Combinations for Muscle Growth.**

*   [Pure Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000)
*   [BCAA Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/instantised-bcaa.html) (Leucine)

Pure whey provides over 24g protein per serving which is sourced from whey protein concentrate and in combination with Branch Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) can contribute to the growth and maintenance of muscle mass. BCAA can be taken on their own or, when unflavoured, can be added to your Pure Whey shake.

### **Supplement Combinations for Immunity.**

*   [Vitamin D3](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitamin-d3-tablets/bpb-vd3t-0000)
*   [Vitamin C](../../vitamin-c-tablets-1000mg.html)

Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) and Vitamin C are two popular additions to the diet and are linked to supporting the immune system. When taken in the right dosages they can both contribute to the normal function of the immune system during and after intense physical exercise.

### **Supplement Combinations for Increased Alertness.**

*   [Caffeine Tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/caffeine-tablets/bpb-caff-t000)
*   [Taurine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/taurine/bpb-taur-0000)

Caffeine is an extremely popular ingredient today and is found in many different foods and drinks, so many that the acceptance of this ingredient has vastly risen. In addition to this, when taken in dosages of around 200mg, Caffeine has been shown to increase alertness and attention and is also a great pairing with the non-essential amino acid, Taurine.

### **Supplement Combinations for Digestive support.**

*   [Chia Seeds](../../chia-seeds.html)

Chia Seeds are a versatile product and can be mixed with shakes or added to foods or salads and are a great source of fibre (9g of fibre per serving) making them a great prebiotic. Complete Probiotic™ is an exclusive BULK POWDERS™ formulation of 5 different strains of probiotic with added digestive enzymes and is a great combination with Chia Seeds.

### Tried and tested combinations.

If you have a specific training goal and you want to make sure you’re incorporating the right supplements into your diet, the five supplement combinations above will stand you in good stead. The synergy between these single ingredients, when combined, is what makes them really effective. Give them a try yourself and see how they work for you.
