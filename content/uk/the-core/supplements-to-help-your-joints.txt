There’s a lot of focus on muscle care and maintenance and it’s easy to overlook our joints. It’s thanks to them that we can move at all in a stable way and it’s fundamental to keep them healthy. In this guide, we’ll focus on supplements to help your joints be at their best.

Essentially, joints are movable connections between two bones. They’re covered with a smooth layer of cartilage that prevents the bones from rubbing against each other more than they should. The cartilage also shifts the pressure in the joint onto the bone. That’s particularly important if we think about the level of pressure that our hip and knee joints receive and the weight they carry every day when we stand up and walk around – let alone intense workout sessions.

How supplements can help your joints
------------------------------------

If high-impact sports like running, your joints could probably do with some supplements. They can help out with low-grade inflammation, pain, swelling, and stiffness.

Do any joint supplements really work? There are many formulas that aim to target joint pain but their effectiveness is often up for debate. As glucosamine levels drop with age,   In this article, we’ll take a look a the most popular ones and what current research can tell us about them.

### **What are the best supplements for your joints?**

Choosing the right supplements for your joints depends on their condition and what you’re looking to improve. For example, if you’re thinking about what to take for joint pain especially if it’s chronic, glucosamine can be beneficial. We’ve rounded up the best supplements for joints below so let’s have a look. 

*   **Glucosamine  
    **It’s one of the most studied supplements as it’s contained in the cartilage around our bones. The benefits depend on how much you take (the recommended dosage is 300 – 500 mg, three times a day, for a total daily dose of 900 – 1,500 mg). Glucosamine sulfate salts seem to be the best form to supplement.
*   **Chondroitin  
    **Often paired with glucosamine, it can help with joint pain and stiffness.
*   **Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)  
    **It can support joint health and it’s also found in formulas with Glucosamine and Chondroitin.
*   **Cissus Quadrangularis  
    **It’s been used for centuries in the Indian Ayurvedic system and it’s the most popular alternative to Glucosamine, Chondroitin or MSM.
*   **Curcumin  
    **It’s the active ingredient in turmeric and it’s also found in ginger. It’s got strong anti-inflammatory properties.
*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids  
    **Omega 3 derives from fish oil and has a number of benefits including contributing to the normal functioning of the heart at a dosage of 250mg EPA and DHA per day. They also have anti-inflammatory properties that can be beneficial for your joints.
*   **Green tea  
    **It has powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may be useful for joint pain.
*   **Calcium  
    **Can be taken a supplement or integrated with food such as dark leafy greens, milk, yoghurt, and broccoli. Calcium can reduce joint inflammation and pain.

### What are the best vitamins for joints?

*   **Vitamin D  
    **People with a vitamin D deficiency can experience joint pain more frequently so integrating it could reduce that. Also, vitamin D facilitates the absorption of calcium and it’s easy to find formulas that contain both.
*   **Vitamin C  
    **It contributes to the normal production of collagen and it also contributes to the general health of bones, skin and cartilage.
*   **Vitamin K  
    **Also supports bone health and it’s often taken with vitamin D.
