Fresh from the Gibraltan kitchen comes this Protein Waffles recipe, served up with attitude by The Muscle Bakery. With 15g protein per waffle and less than 2g fat, these waffles are great if you’re watching your calories, but want something a little bit naughty! Finish it off with fruit or one of our outrageously great tasting nut butters!

### Instructions

1.) Preheat oven to approx. 170 degrees C.

2.) Mix together all the ingredients until you get a pourable batter.

3.) Pour onto a waffle mould and bake in the oven for approximately 15 minutes or until golden. Then leave to cool for a little while, unless you enjoy burning your hand and flip them onto your plate. (You may want to double check them before flipping them out incase they need a few more minutes.)

4.) Alternatively if you have a waffle machine, you could try the batter on that, however we have not tested it ourselves.

5.) Then jazz it up with your fave topping’s, so far we’ve tried raspberries, [peanut butter](../../peanut-butter.html "Peanut Butter"), chocshot, crumbled cookies and more! Own that waffle!
