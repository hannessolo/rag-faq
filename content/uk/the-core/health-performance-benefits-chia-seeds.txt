Chia Seeds (Silvia hispanica) have recently taken the health and fitness world by storm. They have become THE super-food with many people touting a vast array of health and performance benefits. It’s easy to see why these seeds have had such an explosion in popularity after looking at the nutritional information. Chia seeds contain **20% protein per serving**, are **high in ‘good’ fats**, a **great source of carbohydrates**, **low in sugar**, a **rich source of fibre** and a **great source of vitamins and minerals**.

### Protein

Chia Seeds are clearly a rich source of protein with approximately the same amount of protein per 100g as chicken breast. This will help to boost your protein intake and can easily be added to meals, shakes and snacks.

### Essential fats

Chia Seeds have been shown to be a rich source of essential fats. They’re a rich source of Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids (more so than salmon), Alpha Linoleic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Oleic Acid, Stearic Acid and Palmitic Acid.

### Omega 3

Chia Seeds have been shown to increase blood levels of alpha-linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid which are associated with good heart health (Neimen et al 2012). Increased levels of Omega 3 are also associated with a reduction in triglycerides, a reduction in cholesterol and improved joint protection (Norlaily Mohd Ali et al 2012).

### Fibre

Chia Seeds contain more fibre than flaxseed. Fibre content is essential to decreasing appetite and promoting a healthy gut by encouraging the movement of material through the gut and bowels.

### Antioxidants

Chia Seeds are a rich source of antioxidants such as Quercitin, Kaempferol and Myricetin. This will help to reduce oxidative stress associated with general health and exercise. Reducing the effects of oxidative stress can reduce damage to cells and DNA which in turn may reduce your risk of contracting certain diseases. These antioxidants are also associated with anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and antithrombotic activities (Norlaily Mohd Ali et al 2012).

### Other benefits

Chia Seeds have been linked to a number of health benefits such as a reduction in blood pressure and improved the standard lipid panel (Vuksan et al 2007). Chia Seed has also been demonstrated to reduce postprandial glucose spikes, 60 minutes after consuming 50g of carbohydrate (Vuksan et al 2010).
