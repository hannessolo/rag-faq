Our friend Lindsay from Lean Bean Nutrition swung by the BULK POWDERS™ macro kitchen and left this little delight: a delicious Protein Key Lime Pie recipe.

It’s a really simple dessert, using our ‘protein flavour of the month’, Lemon Meringue Pure Whey Protein™.

### Instructions

If you decide to make your own base instead of using a snack bar base, here’s how:

1.) Soak one cup of dates in warm water (enough to cover the surface of the dates).

2.) Leave to soak for 2 hours.

3.) Once soft, add nuts and seed of your choice and 1/2 tbsp melted coconut oil.

4.) Mash and press into a dish and set aside.

**Filling**

1.) In a bowl combine all the filling ingredients. Place the mix on top of the base and freeze for two hours. Top with apple slices and lime zest.
