Natural Talent vs. Burning Ambition

### 40x the Green Coffee content

First of all, you will find at the top of the table, comparable ingredients that can be found in both CUTTING EDGE™ and Grenade® Thermo Detonator. As you can see from the list of ingredients and dosages, CUTTING EDGE™ stacks up extremely well against Grenade® Thermo Detonator.

CUTTING EDGE™ contains a massive 40x Green Coffee content, enhancing the fat loss effects.

Furthermore the comparative dosage of Phenylalanine is huge; CUTTING EDGE™ contains 16x the dose of Phenylalanine compared to Grenade® Thermo Detonator.

[Caffeine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/caffeine-tablets/bpb-caff-t000 "Caffeine Tablets") is another directly comparable ingredient between the two formulas; as you can see 300mg vs 225mg leaves CUTTING EDGE™ coming out on top once again.

### CUTTING EDGE™ takes a different approach to enhance fat loss by suppressing appetite

There are other ingredients within both products that are not directly comparable but show that the formulas take a different approach towards the method of fat loss.

Grenade® Thermo Detonator takes a more stimulant based approach to fat loss through Bitter Orange Powder. This may suit some users looking for a more stimulant based product; however CUTTING EDGE™ takes a different approach to enhance fat loss by suppressing appetite. 3000mg of [Glucomannan](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/glucomannan-konjac-powder/bpb-gman-0000 "Glucomannan") have been added to CUTTING EDGE™ in order to enhance the appetite suppressing effects – reducing overall calorie intake.

### Stabilising your blood sugar levels is vital in order to increase metabolism

Grenade® Thermo Detonator includes Cayenne in order to stimulate thermogenesis (increased body temperature). CUTTING EDGE™ takes a different approach by looking to control blood sugar levels with the addition of Cinnamon Extract. Stabilising your blood sugar levels is vital in order to burn stored fat and increase metabolism.

CUTTING EDGE™ also contributes to normal macronutrient (carbohydrate, fat, protein) metabolism through [Chromium Picolinate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/chromium-picolinate-tablets/bpb-cpic-0000 "Chromium Picolinate Tablets"), Choline Bitartrate and Selenium Methionine.

### Utilises the most bioavailable s../../chromium-picolinate-tablets.htmlource of each ingredient in order to maximise effects

CUTTING EDGE™ utilises the most bioavailable source of each ingredient in order to maximise effects. Each ingredients form is clearly stated and all relevant information with regards to extracts/actives is shown, so that you have the most potent, explicit list of ingredients. Grenade® mentions the main name of the ingredient but fails to mention its type or “active” content.

Using Green Coffee Extract as an example, CUTTING EDGE™ Green Coffee Extract contains 50% Chlorogenic Acid content, compared to Grenade® Thermo Detonator which fails to mention the Chlorogenic Acid content.

Furthermore, CUTTING EDGE™ uses HPMC capsules so that the product is vegetarian and vegan friendly.  Grenade® Thermo Detonator use gelatine capsules, which whilst not inferior, do prevent vegetarians and vegans from using their product.
