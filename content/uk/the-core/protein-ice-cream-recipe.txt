**How to make protein ice cream**
---------------------------------

Add 50g Protein Ice Cream Mix to 125ml milk, shake and freeze. It’s that simple. We’ve worked hard on the recipe so you don’t have to. It’s as easy to make as it is to eat. 

1.  Add 1 heaped scoop (approximately 50g) to 125ml semi-skimmed milk in a shaker, and shake until fully mixed.
2.  Once mixed, pour into a freezer-safe bowl and place in the freezer for 2 hours.
3.  Remove from the freezer for 5-10 minutes to thaw a little.
4.  Enjoy your protein ice cream as a high-protein snack, any time of day.

Consume on the day of freezing and try not to freeze overnight. If frozen for longer than 2 hours, the product solidifies and needs to be thawed for longer.

**How to serve protein ice cream**
----------------------------------

Serve it in a bowl, or if you want to get creative, add some toppings.  Some [Zero Calorie Syrup](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/zero-calorie-syrup/bpf-zcsy) would go very nicely with this, adding some extra sweetness without the calories.
