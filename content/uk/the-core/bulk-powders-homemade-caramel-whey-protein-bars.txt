Making protein bars at home
---------------------------

At BULK POWDERS™ we understand that December can be an expensive month. After Christmas shopping, socialising and seeing in the New Year in style, you may be left feeling that January will be a long month.

So we have cooked up a recipe which will not only save you money, but will also help you stay in shape as the festive season approaches and you find yourself with less time than usual to prepare your normal snacks. To some people getting ready for the festive season means putting up the Christmas lights, but to us it means homemade protein bars.

Pre-prepared protein bars have always been a good source of protein. Handily wrapped in the perfect portion size, they make a great snack for times when you’re on the go, stuck at work or at the gym (or just feeling a little lazy….). But if you’re a bit strapped for cash, or just want to get creative in the kitchen, making your own protein bars is the ideal solution!

You can take the same approach to making your own protein bars as we do when making our [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein.html "Whey Protein") supplements – only the best ingredients will do! You become the quality control manager and have the final say over what your bars contain, giving you the option to choose the ideal set of ingredients to suit your nutritional needs. Plus you can also create bars to suit any dietary requirements, such as making them vegan or gluten free.

Using a recipe from www.proteinpow.com with our **Pure Whey Protein™** in **Toffee Popcorn flavour**, we made some **Caramel Whey Bars**. It was so easy to do that we thought (in the spirit of Christmas) that we’d share our tasty treats with you and have prepared a step-by-step guide showing you how to create your own.

Using the ingredients below we made **12 medium sized bars**, but you could make your own bars bite size or the size of a house brick – whatever you fancy!

Our bars had a fudge-like consistency and **combined our toffee popcorn flavour with chocolate**… perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth who doesn’t want to break their diet to indulge.

If making your own bars doesn’t appeal to you, why not send our video to someone who’ll be giving you a gift this Christmas? Not only an easy gift idea, but it gives you the ideal sweet snack for that lazy afternoon on Christmas Day when everyone else has broken out the Quality Street.

How to make protein bars
------------------------

We made 12 mini bars (similar size to a Penguin Bar) instead of 4 bars suggested by Protein Pow. If you decide to make 4 protein bars, you will be looking at approximately 240kcals, 20g protein, 11g carbs, 11g fat and 4.2g fibre per bar.
