Instructions
------------

1.) Place your silicone moulds in the freezer for half an hour prior to starting the recipe â€“ this makes the chocolate process a lot easier.

2.) Melt the chocolate in the microwave or in a glass bowl over boiling water, and with a small spoon, coat the bottom and sides of the silicone moulds.

3.) Freeze for half an hour while you prepare the filling.

4.) In a bowl, mix peanut butter, milk, pumpkin protein, syrup, oil and agave until you get a creamy consistency. If you want the texture to be on the runny side, add more milk and syrup.

5.) Take out your prepared chocolate coated moulds and fill them all with the mix, and finish by coating them with the melted chocolate (leaving a little bit to stick the biscuits and eyes at the end).

6.) Place back in the freezer to solidify for another half an hour.

7.) Take out the moulds and remove your now solidified peanut butter cups, ready to decorate.

8.) Slice all your biscuits in half and cut marshmallows to preferred size (we used scissors for the marshmallows as they can become quite sticky).

9.) Then, using the remaining melted chocolate, dip biscuits and stick them on as shown in the image. Do the same with the candy eyes and marshmallow teeth.

10.) We still had chocolate left over at the end so just drizzled it all over to make it look messier.

Happy Halloween!
