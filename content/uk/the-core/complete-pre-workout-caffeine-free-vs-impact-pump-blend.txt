Due to the increased popularity of training in the evening, there has been a drive to development caffeine free/stimulant free pre-workouts. We recently launched our Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free, and wanted to take this opportunity to compare against My Protein’s **Impact Pump Blend**. Please take a look at the below table to see how they compare:

Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free

Impact Pump Blend

As you can see from the above list, the ingredients within the products are similar, however the dosing per serving is very different. On all comparable ingredients, **Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free is dosed much higher** than My Protein’s Impact Pump Blend.

[Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-pre-workout-caffeine-free/bble-cpcf) looks to dose all ingredients at proven dosages to work, to ensure that you get the most out of the product, be it more reps in the gym or a better pump.

In addition to the comparable ingredients, Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free contains other ingredients to further improve performance. Choline Bitartrate has been added to improve mental performance and cognition, [Electrolytes](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/electrolyte-powder/bpb-elec-0000) have been added to improve fluid balance in the body, and Vitamin B6 has been added to reduce sensations of tiredness and fatigue – all without the addition of stimulants or caffeine, which may leave you awake all night if you train late at night.

Therefore, before you go out and buy your next stimulant/caffeine free pre-workout, take a look at the dosages and see how they compare to Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free.
