Make 2019 the year you try something new – and freshen up your fitness!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

“Exercise” is such a New Year’s Resolution cliche, but what about those of us who already train? Can “exercise even more” be a resolution? How about this for a twist: “try a new type of exercise”!

If you’re feeling more “blah” than “boom” about January’s training sessions, maybe you need some fresh new ideas to spice things up?

There’s nothing like a brand-new challenge to shake up how you feel about fitness. And it’s never been a better time to give something new a go, with tons of fitness classes, group exercises programmes, and sports available to try.

Here’s our pick of the best classes and sports for 2019. Which will you choose?

Ultimate Frisbee
----------------

Remember playing this at University? Well it’s now a big thing, and coming to a town near you. Ultimate Frisbee turns frisbee throwing into a fast-paced, competitive team sport which will boost your cardio fitness a treat! If you’ve got good co-ordination and feel agile, give it a go! Find a taster session near you.

Hot Yoga
--------

Yoga is one of those things we all know we should do…but never get round to. The trend for hot yoga might just change that. Hotpod Yoga is an official hot yoga franchise which is (literally) popping up all over the UK. Classes are done inside huge inflatable pods, heated to 37\*C, with mood lighting and special music. Strengthen your body, stretch your muscles, build core strength – and stay warm all winter!

HIIS
----

Just as we were all getting used to [HIIT](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/what-is-hiit/) (high intensity interval training), along comes HIIS. HIIS stands for high intensity interval skipping, and it’s going to be a big trend in 2019 with skipping cropping up in classes, PT, and group exercise. But the great thing about skipping is that you can do it yourself, in the gym or even at home (if your ceilings are high enough!). Grab a skipping rope or speed rope and away you go. Skipping is incredible cardio, burning an astounding number of calories (especially once you get into a rhythm!). You’ll also see the benefits for your calves, shoulders, triceps, biceps, legs, and hips. Even if you don’t fully embrace the HIIS trend, why not add a bit of skipping to your training?

Rowing Classes
--------------

Ever noticed how the rowing machines are ignored at the gym? That’s probably because indoor rowing is hard to get right (and downright hard when you can do it properly!). Boutique gyms are tackling the need for proper indoor rowing training, with London’s The Engine Room leading the way. If you can’t make it to The Engine Room for a Row 101 session, why not make 2019 the year of the rowing machine in your own cardio? Concept2 has an online log book, with free challenges you can join all year round. Rowing is a great calorie burner and will get you in shape like nothing else.

Tag Rugby
---------

Rugby is a real all-rounder for fitness, but a lot of people are intimidated by the full game. Well, how about Tag Rugby? It’s like non-contact rugby league, so you can expect a fast, skills-based game which will get you fit before you notice it! Tag Rugby is usually played in teams of seven, and matches last 40 minutes. Like any team game, you’ll have tons of fun and make new mates. What’s not to like? Get started by finding your local group and going to a taster session.

Indoor Cycling
--------------

What’s so new about spinning? Plenty! 2019 will see technology meet indoor cycling so you can have a truly immersive group fitness experience. Think big screens, soundtracks, challenges, and lots of user data so you can pore over your progress. There are boutique indoor cycle offerings (like Psycle, Peloton, and Boom Cycle), or classes fro big hitters like Les Mills (look for The Trip on a cals timetable near you). This is not like any spinning you’ve done before!

Obstacle Course Races
---------------------

Tough Mudder is just one in a number of crazy off-road run challenges which will give you a focus for 2019! There’s also Spartan Race, the Warrior Dash, Rugged Maniac… you get the idea. You don’t have to be a runner – in truth, OCR (obstacle course races) are about climbing, body weight mastery, mindset, quick thinking, and team work with a bit of running in between. You’ll get muddy, you’ll have fun, and you’ll have a big scary reason to focus in one your cardio fitness.

What’s your focus for the year?
