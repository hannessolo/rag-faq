Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the kitchen, The Beltsander casually releases this **VitaFiber™ Protein Chewits recipe**. It may look a bit like dried turkey pieces but we promise it tastes nothing like that – and with only two main ingredients, it’s an absolute doddle to make!

Mrs Beltsander, who can be a difficult woman to please, is reported to be a huge fan!

Here’s how to make them:

### **Method:**

1.) Add the **VitaFiber**™ powder to a small pot on a low heat.

2.) Add 30 mls water and start to whisk the mixture to combine.

3.) Keep whisking until to mixture turns from cloudy to a clear syrup.

4.) Add your **whey protein** to a separate bowl.

5.) Pour the liquid **VitaFiber**™ into the whey and mix to combine,

6.) Pour the mixture out onto parchment paper and use it to shape it roughly into a block.

7.) Leave it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to set.

8.) When it’s set chop it up into cubes.
