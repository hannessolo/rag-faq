### Turkey

High in vitamins B3, B6, as well as selenium, phosphorus and zinc. Turkey is also high in the essential amino acid [**tryptophan**](../../tryptophan.html), helping your mood and to get that all important post-dinner nap.

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Trim any fat where possible.
2.  Slice the meat into thin slices, giving the appearance of having more..sneaky!

### Brussel Sprouts

High in vitamins C, K, as well as being high in fibre to help with your overworked digestive system during the Christmas period.

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Boost protein by topping with some chopped nuts, such as [**Hazelnuts**](../../whole-hazelnuts.html) or **[Walnuts](../../shop-by-range/active-foods/walnut-halves.html "Walnuts")**.
2.  Dig in – the more the merrier!

### Roasted Parsnips

High in b-complex vitamins to help with energy production, as well as vitamin C to act as an antioxidant when consuming copious\* amount of alcohol (\*oops we mean moderate..)

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Opt for small-medium size parsnips to feel like you’re having more.
2.  Use healthy cooking oil, such as [**Organic Virgin Coconut Oil.**](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html)

### Roasted Potatoes

Often regarded as a no go, due to their high carb content, potatoes are a brilliant source of vitamin B6 to help keep the metabolism going! They are also high in vitamin C and potassium.

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Try [**Sweet Potatoes**](../../sweet-potato-powder.html) as an alternative.
2.  Don’t overdo it on the frying!

### Pigs in Blankets

Obviously forgetting the salt and saturated fat content, sausages and bacon are actually a source of iron and vitamin B12, helping to reduce tiredness and fatigue during your busy day of opening presents!

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Make your own with leaner bacon.
2.  Drain excess fat away before serving.

### Sage & Onion Stuffing

As it’s mainly onions and sage leaves, which are actually a potent antioxidant, stuffing really isn’t all bad! Not forgetting the butter component, but this also means vitamins, minerals and healthy fats.

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Try adding our [**Complete Greens™**](../../complete-greens.html) in the mix.
2.  Add a portion of chia seeds to boost protein content.

### Gravy

Not exactly nutritious, however reasonable levels of vitamin B2, Iron, Selenium and Phosphorus.

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Don’t flood your plate with it!
2.  Use [**Complete Greens™**](../../complete-greens.html) in the mix to boost nutritional value.

### Cranberry Sauce

Majority of shop bought versions will be predominantly sugar, however try making your own healthier version with [**Dried Cranberries**](../../dried-cranberries.html) which are high in vitamin C and K as well as being a great source of phytonutrients, boosting your immune system during these cold winter nights.

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Don’t overdo it; think a little goes a long way.
2.  Try a ‘no added sugar’ version, using [**Xylitol.**](../../xylitol.html)

### Christmas Pudding

Packed with mixed fruits, containing a multitude of vitamins and minerals. Extra nuts and spice as well as eggs, can’t be too bad, can it?

**TOP TIPS:**

1.  Make your own and use extra fruit, such as [**Dried Apricots.**](../../dried-whole-apricots.html)
2.  Make a high protein sauce by heating our [**Cinnamon Roasted Almond Butter**](../../cinnamon-almond-butter.html).

Have a Merry Christmas!!
