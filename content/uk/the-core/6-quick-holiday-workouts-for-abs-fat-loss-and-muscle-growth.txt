Taking a break from training to enjoy your summer holiday is highly recommended. But if you’re working towards specific goals, and want some simple sets to keep you on track, we have some effective bodyweight movements you can take anywhere. Thanks to our ambassadors, here are 6 quick holiday workouts.

**1\. Twins’ Bodyweight HIIT Blitz**
------------------------------------

First up we’ve got a [**Bodyweight HIIT Workout**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcsffFusMa8/) by [**@twinsb\_fit**](https://www.instagram.com/twinsb_fit/). This may only include four movements, but with five rounds and high-rep ranges, it’s an absolute killer. 

*   **Burpees: 12 reps**

*   **Squats: 16 reps**

*   **Jumping jacks: 12 reps**
*   **High knees: 25 reps per leg**

_Do 5 rounds with 45 seconds rest in between each._

**2\. Ella-Mae Rayner’s Ab Torcher**
------------------------------------

Here’s a [**10-minute Ab Workout**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKF2YdeFBrY) from Ella-May Rayner. You could easily do this in your hotel room as a holiday workout. 

*   **Controlled sit-ups**

*   **Butterflies** (here’s [**Anthony Joshua doing some**](https://www.tiktok.com/@bulk/video/6634884731815070981?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1) too)

*   **Leg raises**

*   **Single-leg v-ups**

*   **Side plank (left side )**

*   **Side Plank (right side)**

*   **Side sit-ups**

*   **Russian twists**

*   **Plank**

_Spend 50 seconds on each exercise, and rest for 10 seconds in between. 1 round is enough, but do 2 if you want a gruelling challenge._

**3\. Joe Delaney’s Upper Body Burn**
-------------------------------------

Here’s an [**Advanced Upper Body Workout**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RdDmwHiT1M) from Joe Delaney that you could easily do away, whether it’s a hotel room floor or the kitchen in your Airbnb. It mainly utilises the chest, but also includes some movements isolating the triceps.

Since you’re working with a finite weight (your bodyweight), the main variable you can change is reps. Work off a ‘reps in reserve system’ (or 1 rep from failure).

**Set 1** – 3-5 reps in reserve 

**Set 2 & 3** – 1-2 reps in reserve 

**Set 4** – 0 reps in reserve (AMRAP)

You need adequate rest between sets. If you’re training for hypertrophy, you want to be careful that it doesn’t turn into a circuit.

*   **Conventional press-ups**

*   **Platform press-ups** (increased range of motion) 

*   **Chair (Incline) press-ups**

*   **Rucksack Incline press-ups**

*   **Dips**

*   **Archer press-up**

_Perform each exercise for 4 sets, not as a circuit. 60-90 seconds rest between each exercise._

**4\. Ella-Mae Rayner’s Full-body HIIT**
----------------------------------------

Another workout from Ella-Mae. This time it’s a super-intense [**HIIT Workout**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcKujhqpk-U/), using compound movements such as squats and burpees to induce a satisfying full-body blitz.

*   **Squat taps**

*   **Burpees**

*   **Squat crunches**

*   **Mountain climbers**

*   **Jumping lunges**

*   **Suicide drills**

*   **Squat jumps**

_40 seconds on, 20 seconds off. 4 rounds._

**5\. Alex Crockford’s No Equipment Chest Circuit**
---------------------------------------------------

Similar to Joe Delaney’s chest holiday workout, this is another hotel chest workout from [**Alex Crockford**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcj4MqNEpqg)**.** Rather than using RPE, Alex uses times to signify how long you should do each movement. 

*   **Push-up side steps**

*   **Incline chair push-ups**

*   **Decline chair push-ups**

*   **Hand release push-ups**

*   **Spiderman push-ups**

_Perform each movement for 20 seconds, and rest for 10 seconds between each. Do 3 rounds as a circuit._

**6\. Hayley Madigan’s HIIT Holiday** 
--------------------------------------

Perfect for when you’re travelling or find yourself with limited equipment, this [**Bodyweight HIIT Workout**](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfoxLZMLIfW/)  from [**Hayley Madigan**](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CfoxLZMLIfW/) is an efficient calorie burner.

*   **Skaters x 20**

*   **Walking lunges x 10 per leg**

*   **Sprints x 4 lengths**

*   **Broad jump with shuffle x 6**

*   **Jumping lunges x 10 per leg**
*   **Squat shuffle with floor touch x 5 per side**

_Repeat 3 or 4 times depending on fitness, ability and time._

Remember, finding ways to workout over summer isn’t essential. There are many reasons why taking a week or so off from training can actually benefit you, as Hayley Madigan herself explains in this blog, you don’t always need to worry about your **[gains on holiday](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/why-you-dont-need-to-worry-about-your-gains-on-holiday/)**. But for those who crave the buzz of a workout done well, or need to train for sharpness and mental clarity, these six workouts offer some great options and variety.
