BULK POWDERS™ athlete **[James DeGale](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/bulkpowders-james-degale-formalise-partnership/)**, aims to make the second defence of his IBF Super Middleweight World Title this weekend. James takes on mandatory challenger, Rogelio ‘Porky’ Medina from Mexico. The fight takes place in Washington DC on Saturday 30th April (Sunday 1st UK time).

On the same card, Badou Jack defends his WBC title against Lucian Bute, who James recently beat in Canada. The winners of each fight have agreed to fight each other later in the year, to unify the IBF and WBC belts. When BULK POWDERS™ asked James about the unification fight he said, “I have to concentrate on Medina – while he’s been beaten a few times, he’s also knocked out 30 opponents which shows he can bang. I’ll have to be switched on, but I expect to win in style.” Asked who he would prefer to face out of Jack and Bute, James said, “I’d prefer Jack. I’ve already beaten Bute, beaten him well and in front of his own fans. There isn’t anything to prove there. But if I have to beat him again, we can do it in London this time.”

James’ title defence will be shown live on Sky Sports 1, starting at 02:00 on Sunday 1st May. Keep an eye out for our BULK POWDERS™ water bottles in the ring!
