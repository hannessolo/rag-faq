Protein recipes to get inspired in the kitchen
----------------------------------------------

**_Sick of eating chicken, rice and broccoli every day? Struggling for healthy cooking ideas? Want to treat yourself with a dessert but feel guilty eating gooey chocolaty treats? Sounds like you need some inspiration…_**

Then look no further than [Protein Pow](http://www.proteinpow.com/ "Protein Pow"). From its humble beginnings as a side project to Anna Sward’s PhD studies, Protein Pow is now a fully functioning company providing workshops around the UK. Anna has appeared in several magazines, on health and fitness websites and has published [Protein Pow(d)er: the Cookbook](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Protein-Pow-d-er-Cookbook/dp/0957356706/ "Anna Sward Protein Pow(d)er Cookbook on Amazon") championing the cause for healthy yet delicious nutrition. Who says healthy eating has to be boring!?

You too can get creative by sharing Anna’s passion for exercise, cooking and delicious finger licking good food. Protein powder for starters isn’t just a protein shake. You can use protein powder in countless recipes from cake and cereal to pizza and pasta. And protein isn’t just whey protein. The possibilities are endless with [egg white protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/egg-white-powder.html "BULK POWDERS™ Egg White Powder"), [brown rice protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/brown-rice-protein-80.html "BULK POWDERS™ Brown Rice Protein"), [pea protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/super-pea-protein-isolate.html "BULK POWDERS™ Pea Protein"), [hemp protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/hemp-protein.html), casein protein and beef protein all perfect for cooking up a storm in the kitchen.

Protein is just one ingredient to add into the mix. With fun, funky and fresh healthy recipes in mind, Anna inspires fellow protein chefs by using other ingredients readily available from BULK POWDERS™. [BULK POWDERS™ Liquid Egg Whites](https://www.bulk.com/uk/liquid-egg-whites.html "BULK POWDERS™ Liquid Egg Whites 1kg"), [Pistachio Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pistachio-butter.html "BULK POWDERS™ Pistachio Butter 1kg"), [Almond Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/almond-butter.html "BULK POWDERS™ Almond Butter"), [Coconut Oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "BULK POWDERS™ Organic Virgin Coconut Oil 460g"), [LiquiFlavs](https://www.bulk.com/uk/bp-liquiflav-50ml.html "BULK POWDERS™ LiquiFlavs"), [Quinoa Flour](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-quinoa-flour.html "BULK POWDERS™ Quinoa Flour") and [Scottish Oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html "BULK POWDERS™ Ultra Fine Scottish Oats") are a mainstay on Anna’s kitchen shelves.

Anyone can take part in a Protein Pow Workshop but tickets sell like hot cakes. Whether you’re an experienced chef or a complete novice, a willingness to learn and a healthy appetite is all that’s required to take part.

The Protein Pow Workshop Experience
-----------------------------------

When Anna announced the launch of her Protein Pow Cooking Workshop in London, we were delighted to get involved. Held on June 23rd 2013 between 12-6pm in one of London’s most exclusive cooking locations, the 20 attendees including WBFF Pro Muscle Athlete Jamie Alderton gathered for gourmet coffees before undertaking their protein recipe masterclass. After being given a specially designed Protein Pow apron proudly displaying the BULK POWDERS™ logo on the front, the team got to work.

The Workshop was educational as well as inspirational. Rather than jumping straight into the cooking, attendees were given some fascinating insight into the nutritional profiles of the ingredients they would be using and how to use them.

Anna said of the day, “During the workshop we made Protein Bars, Protein Cakes, Protein Muffins, and Protein Pizzas using BULK POWDERS™ protein powders – whey, hemp, and pea – as well as coconut oil, egg whites, and nut butters. Everyone had a blast discovering new products and finding out how they can use them in the kitchen!”

“Part of what I love the most about these workshops is the fact that people get to know each other and become friends through sharing their passion for food. It’s what cooking should be all about really – bringing people together! I log on to Facebook now and see them all having group conversations about cooking and I smile because it was their interest for food – and their dedication to fitness – that brought them together. During the workshop someone said, “I love that I get to spend the day talking about exercise and nutrition, eating great food, finding new products that I otherwise wouldn’t have tried, and learning more about cooking! I never get to do this!”

By the time the workshop came to a close, everyone felt they were fully prepared to go home and transform their favourite unhealthy cheat meals into high protein, sugar free, healthy and nutritious meals and snacks. Their approach to cooking had changed, they had become protein superheroes, ready to spread the word and reinvent themselves as protein gurus.

A special BULK POWDERS™ discount code was given to each attendee for money off their next order so they could buy the ingredients at a discounted price and start cooking.
