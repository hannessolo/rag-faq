Protein Chocolate Santas are a fun limited-edition Christmas product. We’ve taken delicious high protein chocolate and shaped them into everyone’s favourite festive figure – Santa. Delivering 11g protein per pack, this festive product really is the ideal treat at this time of year.

Pure Whey Protein™ **– Gingerbread Latte**
------------------------------------------

It’s hard to resist the temptation of a gingerbread latte or Christmas flavoured drink at this time of year. Now you don’t have to miss out on the taste of Christmas with our Limited Edition Gingerbread Latte flavoured [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html). Along with our other 23 flavours, our Pure Whey Protein provides outstanding value for money and is a premium quality whey protein powder.

Pure Whey Protein™ – Chocolate Malted Honeycomb Flavour

You don’t have to lose your gains just because it’s Christmas! [Pure Whey Protein™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pure-whey-protein.html) makes an ideal choice for anyone looking to complement their existing healthy lifestyle and get a massive 23g protein per serving. What’s better, the tasty Chocolate Malted Honeycomb flavour means it will be a favourite over the many boxes of chocolates.

Chocolate Protein Bites™
------------------------

Everyone needs to get their chocolate fix once in a while, especially around Christmas! Our [Chocolate Protein Bites™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chocolate-protein-bites.html) make the perfect gift to satisfy those chocolate cravings – containing 30g of protein per 100g.

[Chocolate Whey Balls™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/chocolate-whey-balls.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are a great stocking filler but one word of warning: they’re really addictive! Once you start, it’s difficult to stop eating them! Suitable for anyone looking for a tasty treat that is also high in protein. They are ideal for ‘cheat days’, so why not increase your protein intake at the same time.

Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Butter
------------------------------

Our [Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/dark-chocolate-hazelnut-butter.html?sqr=dark%20chocolate&) is artisan handmade in the UK. This means that each and every tub has been freshly and carefully made by hand for you to enjoy. It’s packed with good fats, 15g protein per 100g and has a delicious dark chocolate taste. It is also considered as a healthier alternative to Nutella®, so it feels like the ultimate treat. Be prepared for the tub to be opened and finished on Christmas Day!

Nuts
----

This is where you can get creative! You could make a Christmas hamper filled with our selection of [Nuts and Seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nuts-seeds.html). Nuts make the ideal snack; whether between meals or on the go. They are also a great source of protein and healthy fats. For example, [Almonds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/whole-almonds.html) contain 21g of protein per 100g and are high in poly and monounsaturated fats. With our selection, you’re sure to find something for everyone. You could even slip in a tub or two of [nut butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters.html) to really make their day!

For the Chocoholic

[Organic Cacao Liquor Buttons](https://www.bulk.com/uk/organic-cacao-liquor-buttons.html) have a rich and chocolate-like taste, so are perfect for adding to your foods, using whilst baking, or simply consuming on their own. They are very similar to chocolate, but are a whole lot better for you!

Our [Cacao Protein Brownie Mix](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cacao-protein-brownie-mix.html) makes 12 delicious, rich, chocolate brownies, perfect for any occasion! Whether it’s post-workout or to snack on during the day, these scrumptious brownies are a must have and are super easy to make.
