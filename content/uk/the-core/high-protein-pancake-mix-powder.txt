Just in time for Pancake Day!
-----------------------------

We’ve experienced **HUGE demand** for a protein pancake mix. Well the wait is finally over. We tossed up some ideas to see how they panned out and now the launch day has crêped up on us.

Introducing [Complete High Protein Pancakes™](../../complete-high-protein-pancakes.html "Complete High Protein Pancakes™"), this flipping amazing protein pancake mix will transform your pancake making skills in the kitchen for the better (or batter…).

It really couldn’t be easier – simply mix in a shaker as you would any other protein shake then leave the protein pancake mix to stand for 2 minutes. Heat a non-stick frying pan with a little oil then create around 6 small American-style pancakes in the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side. Job done.

### What’s in the protein pancake mix?

As with all BULK POWDERS™ products which require heating, we have used our unique [heat stable](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/heating-stability-of-whey/ "Heating Stability of Whey") [Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/what-is-hydrolysed-whey-protein-isolate/ "What is hydrolysed whey protein isolate?") resulting in no denaturing of the protein.

Complete High Protein Pancakes™ is a multi-protein blend along with Milk Protein Concentrate and Egg White Powder. This ensures you get a varied release of protein (fast and slow) with an array of amino acids.

[Ultra Fine Scottish Oats](../../ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html "Instant Ultra Fine Oats Powder") have been included to give you a slow release of complex carbohydrates, perfect if you’re having Complete High Protein Pancakes™ for breakfast.

**One serving** delivers a **MASSIVE 36g protein** (72%), 6.9g carbs (0.9g sugar) and 1g fat. BULK POWDERS™ Complete Protein Pancakes™ have approximately 7 x more protein than a regular pancake!

### Three gorgeous flavours

Our chefs in the BULK Bakery have come up with three gorgeous launch flavours – **Original**, **Maple Syrup** and **Lemon Zest**.

Original has no added flavour, colour or sweetener but still has a delicious authentic pancake taste and texture. The idea behind this is for you to get your creative hats on and create your own! You can do absolutely anything you like when using Original flavour.

Maple Syrup and Lemon Zest are bursting with flavour that will literally make your mouth water every time you take a bite.

On sale in 500g (10 servings) and 1kg (20 servings) sizes from just £8.99.

### How does our protein pancake mix compare to the rest?

Complete High Protein Pancakes™ are much higher in **protein** than other protein pancake mixes. Whilst ours provides 72% protein per 100g, others deliver just 56-68% protein.

Complete High Protein Pancakes™ serve up just 2.3g of **fat** per 100g. Other mixes predominantly range from 5.8g to 8.0g, a big difference.

Looking at **carbohydrates**, whilst our pancakes deliver 13.8g per 100g, others on the market come in at 19.4g, 21.3g and 38g with, as a result, double or triple the amount of **sugar** than our mix.

The **calorie** counts also favour Complete High Protein Pancakes™. With 366 calories per 100g, competitor pancake mixes come in at 369, 382, 388 and 390 calories.

Finally, our protein pancake mix incorporates **heat stable protein** sources unlike other mixes which use whey concentrate which isn’t heat stable.

### Suggested additional ingredients

Try adding our [chia seeds](../../chia-seeds.html "Chia Seeds"), nut butters, [spinach powder](../../spinach-powder.html "Spinach Powder"), almonds (crushed), hazelnuts or walnuts to your protein pancakes for even more nutritional benefits. Take a look at this [Spinach and Blueberry Pancake Recipe](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/spinach-blueberry-pancake-recipe/ "Spinach & Blueberry Pancake Recipe").
