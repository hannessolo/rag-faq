The physical and nutritional demands of a rugby player are great. It takes a significant amount of nutrition (and calories) to build a strong functional physique, and to keep it fuelled through intensive training and competitive games.

Consuming a significant amount of calories from food isn’t always easy. It’s not cheap either. As such, supplements represent a convenient and affordable way to increase calorie intake, up protein levels and support recovery – without any fuss.

### **So what attributes can benefit a rugby player?**

Depending on position, **size** is an attribute that can be advantageous. Ever tried moving a large rock? Difficult, right? **Explosive power** is another; that ability to explode out from a standing-start or out of a tackle. **Endurance** is an obvious one; having the engine and muscular capacity to keep on running, to keep on attacking, right up until the final whistle. **Recovery too.** You can be a great player but if your recovery is below par, your performance will ultimately suffer.

Here are 4 supplement formulations that can help you become the player you want to be.

### **Pre Workout / ELEVATE™  
**

Before you take on a tough training session or head into a game, you want to be sure that you’re mentally switched on and ready to go. Our pre-workout, [ELEVATE](../../elevate.html)™, contains a 250mg serving of **Caffeine** and 400mg of **L-Tyrosine**. This combination of nutrients is perfect for **increasing focus** and general **preparedness.**

But that’s only half the battle. Making sure you’re on top form while you compete on the field of play is just as important, and **endurance** plays a big part in this. The inclusion of **Beta Alanine** and **Citrulline Malate** contributes to a reduction in muscle fatigue during exercise. They regulate the build-up of hydrogen ions and ammonia in muscle tissue, which slows down the rate of fatigue – effectively enabling you to **train harder, for longer**.

### **Intra / Complete Hydration Drink™  
**

At every stage of competition it’s **important to maintain good levels of hydration**. It’s one of the most overlooked considerations for athletes, but perhaps the most important. Poor hydration can impact performance a number of ways; reduced metabolic function, pH levels and cellular function. A common side effect in rugby is the offset of cramp.

A product like [**Complete Hydration Drink**](../../complete-hydration-drink.html)™ is designed to combat this. It contains optimal amounts of carbohydrates and electrolytes, in addition to **[BCAA](../../instantised-bcaa.html)** and **[Vitamin B6](../../vitamin-b6-powder.html)**. This contributes to the **maintenance of endurance performance**, enhanced absorption of water during exercise, normal energy metabolism and a reduction in tiredness and fatigue.

It can be used pre, intra and post training to make sure hydration and energy stores are at the levels needed for top **performance and recovery**.

### **Post Workout / AFTERMATH™  
**

**At the end of a game you know you’ve been in a battle**. Chances are you’ve been hit a few times and your body is letting you know about it. Charging about, tracking back and making important tackles is part-and-parcel of being a rugby player, but it definitely takes its toll.

When the final whistle blows, **it’s time to refuel** and this means consuming a quality source of protein and carbohydrates to kick start the rebuilding process. Your **muscles need protein** to repair and grow, and carbohydrates to replenish your depleted energy reserves.

Our premium all-in-one supplement, **[AFTERMATH](../../aftermath.html)™** is the ideal post workout drink. It contains ingredients of the absolute highest quality – Pure Whey Isolate, Vitargo, Leucine, Creapure®, Glutamine and HMB. This formulation is designed to stimulate protein synthesis and muscle growth – ensuring rapid uptake of nutrients when you need them most.

The addition of [Creapure®](../../creapure-creatine-monohydrate.html), a premium form of Creatine Monohydrate, is well suited to the sport of rugby as it is known to **increase power and performance** during high intensity movements – such as sprints and tackles.

### MASS GAINER / INFORMED MASS™

For players looking to **pack on a bit of size**, it’s important to consume enough calories in the day. If you’re playing frequently and trying to bulk up too, your calorie requirements will grow significantly. But the challenge is sourcing good quality calories; it’s not always easy. There’s only so much chicken and rice you can eat in one sitting!

This is when a premium mass gainer like **INFORMED MASS**™ can really help. Depending on your calorie needs it can be consumed in the morning, or immediately after a game, delivering protein, carbohydrates and amino acids quickly – **increasing your calorie intake without fuss**. Consuming calories in this way is easier than trying to do so from food alone.

If your position warrants increasing size so you can **hit harder, or take more hits**, try [**INFORMED MASS**](../../informed-mass.html)™.
