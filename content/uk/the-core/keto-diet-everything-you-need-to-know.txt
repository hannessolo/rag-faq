**Ketosis – noun** **/kɪˈtəʊsɪs/****:** _a metabolic state characterised by raised levels of ketone bodies in the body tissues, which is typically pathological in conditions such as diabetes, or may be the consequence of a diet that is very low in carbohydrates._

Keto diets have been gaining a lot of momentum as modern-day lifestyles demand more time for living and less for eating (no, seriously). The keto diet is low in carbs, high in fat and claims to help you burn fat more effectively.

Useful for losing excess body fat without suffering nagging hunger pains, the keto diet looks to the very origin of the human species – hunter gatherers – for inspiration. All-natural foods get a thumbs up (think butter, meat, eggs) but carbs (bread, pasta, rice) get a firm shake of the head.
