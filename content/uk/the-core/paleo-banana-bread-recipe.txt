### Summary

Feed your primal urges with this Paleo Banana Bread recipe. This bread, packed with 7.6g of protein, is so moist and tasty it could almost pass as a cake…either way, it’s ready to be ravaged. Spears (or spoons) at the ready!

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 165C

2.) In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the banana bread and blend until smooth using a hand blender.

3.) Scrape the batter into a lined and lightly oiled 1lb loaf tin.

4.) In a small bowl, mix together the ingredients for the cocoa swirl. Drizzle over the top of the batter and, using a skewer, drag it around the surface into a pattern. Pop in the oven and bake for 35 minutes.
