Some say Elke at The Muscle Bakery is actually Banksy and that if she were to open her own theme park, she’d have customers whizzing down the helter skelter on giant slices of Melba Toast into a pool of **Bulk™** Peanut Butter at the bottom.

Nutella is amazing. It’s probably on a par with Biscoff Spread. Obviously not as tasty as our [Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut), Almond Butter, Cashew Butter and Nuts About Whey™. But close.

But lets be honest, the macros aren’t great. If you eat a lot of it, you’ll make gains around your belly, gains that will wobble rather than make your abs as firm as Michelle Lewin’s glutes. But fear not, The Muscle Baker has come to the rescue with Bulktella – a high protein chocolate spread that you can make at home with only four ingredients. YES – [Homemade High Protein Chocolate Spread](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/high-protein-chocolate-spread-recipe-bulktella/)! One large serving… or knife spread… comes with just 159 calories, a whopping 23.2g of protein and just 13.6g of carbs.

What she does with the spread when Mr Muscle Baker is around, well, that’s a different topic entirely. We might revisit that later. Or leave it to your imagination.

Enjoy!
