**What is** **Rhodiola Rosea (4% Rosavins)?**
---------------------------------------------

Rhodiola Rosea, also known as Golden Root, Arctic Root, Rose Root, Russian Rhodiola and Aaron’s Rod originates from Siberia and Northwestern China and grows in the colder climates around the world. It is considered an adaptogen, meaning this natural plant source helps our bodies adapt to internal or external environmental stresses, and avoid any damage these could cause. These include health factors such as, stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue and sports endurance. BULK POWDERS™ offers you a source containing an impressive 4% of the active compound Rosavins, giving you the maximum benefits of this extraordinary supplement.

**What does** **Rhodiola Rosea** **do?**
----------------------------------------

Rhodiola Rosea basically works by inhibiting cortisol, the ‘stress hormone’ your adrenal gland secretes in response to stress, whilst increasing the ‘happy hormone’ serotonin. It will increase your resistance to daily physical, chemical and biological stresses, helping the body maintain homeostasis. Benefits documented include, strengthening the nervous system, fight depression, enhance immunity, increase exercise capacity, improve memory, aid weight loss and recovery and improve general energy levels.

_‘One particular study showed single-time use of Rhodiola Rosea (at a dose of 370mg or 555mg) in 161 male military cadets proved effective in aiding sleep deprivation and stress in comparison to the placebo.’_

_‘Similarly another studied showed taking 200mg of Rhodiola Rosea 1 hour before endurance exercise helped improve performance.’_

These studies are encouraging by the fact they are based on single-time usage of Rhodiola Rosea, showing the effectiveness of this supplement. Other supplements can take a while to ‘kick in’ and start showing results, Rhodiola Rosea however, is something you can take once and still get great benefits from.

**Quantity and timing:**

BULK POWDERS™ recommends taking 0.3g (300mg) around 1-2 times daily. It is best taken with water and consumed just before or with food. This said, studies have shown mental performance benefits from as little as 170mg daily.

**Summary**:

Rhodiola Rosea is a non-toxic and non-addictive natural plant source known as an adaptogen. Research has shown it to improve endocrine and nervous system function. It can be taken at any point during the day, such as pre and post exercise, however it is extremely beneficial during stressful periods such as dieting or intense training/competition.
