**Which are the best vitamin supplements to overcome tiredness and fatigue?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leading a healthy lifestyle ought to leave us energised. All that healthy food, sensible bedtimes, plus the exercise of course. But when you train hard, it’s inevitable that you’ll feel tired from time to time. The risk of fatigue gets even greater if you are dieting, training for an event, or doing two-a-day sessions. Make sure your diet is topped up with the [best vitamin supplements](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamins) to fight tiredness and make the most of training, recovery, and de-loads!

**The 5 Best Vitamins for More Energy & Less Fatigue**
------------------------------------------------------

### **Vitamin B Complex**

The B vitamins in a Vitamin B Complex include B12 which we also include below. As some of the best vitamins within a Vitamin B Complex, the vitamins work to help your body maintain its energy levels, particularly brain function and alertness. Our [B Vitamin Complex tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/b-vitamin-complex-tablets/bpb-bvit-0000) have all of the B Vitamins plus some helpful extras: biotin, inositol, PABA and choline. Our body’s natural levels of the B Vitamins can be negatively affected by a bad diet, alcohol, or stress. You can increase levels of B vitamins through your diet, but it’s a good idea to take a Vitamin B Complex to ensure all the necessary vitamins are present in optimal doses.

### **Vitamin B12**

[Vitamin B12](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitamin-b12-tablets-1000-mcg/bpb-vb12-0000) is one of the vitamins you’ll find in a Vitamin B Complex, but it’s worth a mention on its own. Lack of Vitamin B12 can affect the function of the nervous system and the brain, giving you more energy and stamina. As one of the best vitamins for fatigue, it seems particularly important if you’re tired because of physical pain or a nagging injury.

### **Vitamin C**

Vitamin C is usually associated with immune system problems, but it’s also one of the best vitamins for energy levels, too. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant and healer, which can help our bodies to deal with bacteria and viruses. Vitamin C can even reduce the duration of colds. There’s an obvious link between Vitamin C’s wellness-boosting abilities and tiredness. If you can fight off illness in less time, then you will spend less time feeling drained and fatigued, too. But there’s more to it than that. Vitamin C has been linked to a reduction in DOMS after training. Our advice? At the first sign of a sniffle, dose up with [Vitamin C](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamin-c-tablets-1000mg.html). And if you’ve been exposed to a lot of germs, use Vitamin C as a precaution. Prevent tiredness before it needs treating!

### **Complete Multivitamin Complex™**

One way to get it all ticked off is with a good multivitamin like our [Complete Multivitamin Complex™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-multivitamin-complex.html) (also available as a [powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-multivitamin-complex-powder/bble-cmvc-powd)). The benefit of choosing this over a single-vitamin supplement is that you get the lot: antioxidants, probiotics, vitamins, and minerals. Tiredness could be attributed to mineral deficiency, too, in particular magnesium and iron. A good quality multivitamin will give you everything you need in one convenient daily dose, so you don’t need to take several tablets and calculate your intake.

### **SPORTS MULTI AM:PM™**

If you’re training really hard, prepping for a show, or deep into endurance sport then it’s extra important to cover all your bases. Our [SPORTS MULTI AM:PM™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/sports-multi-am-pm/bpps-smul) is a smart version of a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement, with different multi blends for day and night. It has absolutely everything you need. In terms of combating tiredness, the AM capsules include an Energy & Cognitive Complex™ (7 ingredients, including B Vitamins) and an Immune Blend™ (8 ingredients, including Vitamin C). Then the PM capsules include Oxidative Stress Protection™, 4 ingredients including selenium and Vitamin D. It’s the king of multi formulas to protect your body from the stresses of training, dieting, and lifestyle.

**7 Ways to Tackle Tiredness**
------------------------------

1.) Are your calories high enough? Unless you’re dieting, make sure your energy intake matches your activity levels.

2.) Manage stress as best you can. Stress, anxiety, and worry can drain your energy levels and leave you feeling exhausted.

3.) Go to bed earlier. Don’t ignore the importance of sleep (it should be the first thing you fix when you’re tired).

4.) Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and free from electronic light (and don’t take your phone into your room).

5.) Consider cutting back on sugary foods, processed foods, and any other food that doesn’t make you feel great.

6.) Remove the booze. Alcohol might make you feel sleepy, but it actually disrupts sleep and leaves you feeling tired.

7.) Try taking magnesium salt baths. Not only are they relaxing, but they can help replenish the mineral magnesium which can be a factor in tiredness.
