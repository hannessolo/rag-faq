### Greater value for money.

Taking a look at the above table you can see a number of similarities between the two products, but also a couple of differences. First of all you can see the difference in price, when comparing both finished product and price per kg. INFORMED WHEY® offers greater value for money on the finished product (IW 2.27kg £42.99 vs ON 2.27kg £48.95) and on a price per kg basis (IW £18.94 vs ON £21.56).

### More protein per serving.

When looking at a premium whey protein supplement, the amount of protein per serving is one of the most important factors. As you can see from the table, INFORMED WHEY® offers 81% protein content, whereas ON Gold Standard 100% Whey offers 78.6% protein content. This higher protein content, really helps to make INFORMED WHEY® the most premium whey protein supplement on the market.

### Informed Sport approved.

INFORMED WHEY® also offers the additional benefit of being [Informed Sport](../../sports-nutrition/informed-sport) approved. Every single batch of INFORMED WHEY® that we manufacture is sent to Informed Sport to be banned substance tested, providing re-assurance to all tested athletes, armed forces and all those who want to avoid banned substances.

### Premium Whey Protein Isolate.

Both INFORMED WHEY® and Gold Standard 100% Whey utilise Whey Protein Isolate as its primary source of protein. This is due to its superior absorption rate, higher protein content, reduced carbohydrate and fat content, as well as higher amino acid content.

### Added Leucine.

To further improve the amino acid content of the whey protein, INFORMED WHEY® includes added Leucine. This helps to boost the amino acid content and specifically the BCAA content of INFORMED WHEY®. ON Gold Standard 100% Whey does not contain any added amino acids, but instead relies upon the amino acids within the whey protein.

### Premium probiotic.

INFORMED WHEY® contains the premium probiotic Lactospore®. This helps to support gut health and promote an environment that can utilise the nutrients within INFORMED WHEY®. Gold Standard 100% Whey does not contain any probiotics.

Both INFORMED WHEY® and Gold Standard 100% Whey contain Digestive Enzymes. INFORMED WHEY® utilises the premium digestive enzyme DigeZyme® – to ensure you are obtaining the highest quality digestive enzymes to support the digestion of all nutrients within INFORMED WHEY®.

### Better on price, protein content and added ingredients.

To conclude, you can see that INFORMED WHEY® outcompetes Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey on a number of aspects outlined above; price, protein content and added ingredients. So why not make the switch and pick up [INFORMED WHEY](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/informed-whey/bpps-iwhe)® today?
