If you’re a regular gymgoer, it’s easy to forget how much you can achieve with minimal equipment such as a resistance band and your body weight. Our #TeamBulk ambassador [@alexfitcleland](https://www.instagram.com/alexfitcleland/?hl=en) has put together a super-easy-to-follow resistance band home workout you can count on during these lockdown days. All you need is a bit of space and a resistance band of whatever level of resistance you’re comfortable with.

Resistance Band Overhead Clean & Press
--------------------------------------

This is a full-body exercise designed to activate a variety of muscles with a focus on your shoulders, deltoids, glutes as well as quads and calves. If you’re looking for a strengthening and conditioning challenge, this is the one for you. Complete 5 sets with 12 reps each to get the most out of this exercise.

### Prep

1.  Step on your resistance band with your feet shoulder-width apart and shoulders tucked back in. Engage your core and glutes.
2.  Start bending your arms to create tension in the band.

### Lift

1.  Bend your knees slightly and bend your arms at an angle with the palms facing up.
2.  Straighten your legs and fully extend your arms towards the ceiling.

Resistance Band Back Squat
--------------------------

As with any squat exercise, the key areas here are your glutes and quads. Thanks to the band’s resistance, you’ll easily get more out of this classic exercise without even using weights. Pay extra attention to keep a straight back while making sure that your knees are stable and complete 4 sets of 12 reps each.

### Prep

1.  Once again, step on your resistance band with your feet shoulder-width apart and shoulders tucked back in. As always, engage your core and glutes for stability.
2.  Put the resistance band around your neck. Adjust the position so that the band can rest behind your neck, not on it – just like you would in a bar squat.

### Push

1.  Lower into a squat position making sure your posture isn’t compromised. As your knees bend and move slightly forward, don’t allow them to go past your toes. Keep your back straight and glutes engaged to support the movement
2.  Press through your heels while squeezing your glutes and steadily stand up to push through the band’s resistance. The tension will act as the obstacle, just like weights would.

Resistance Band Upright Row
---------------------------

Want to build shoulder and upper back strength? Maintaining good form at a steady pace will help you get more out of this exercise. Focus on keeping your back straight and core engaged while you do 4 sets of 10 reps each.

### Prep

1.  You guessed it, start by stepping on your resistance band with your feet shoulder-width apart.
2.  Make sure your feet are stable on the ground.
3.  Keep your arms bent at the elbows and hold the resistance band at both ends.
4.  With your palms facing in, start lifting the band towards your chest.

### Lift

![resistance band upright row lower](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resistance-band-exercise-3-step-4.jpg)

1.  Lift the resistance band aiming to keep your elbows higher than your forearms and hands.
2.  Your resistance band should now have reached your chest.
3.  Keep your shoulders tucked in moving away from your ears.
4.  Pause at the top for a moment and return to the starting position.
