### Summary

Legend has it, the mighty Hercules used to eat carrot cake every day for dessert, in-between fighting and defeating mythical creatures. Here’s the very same recipe, utilising our Mince Pie Pure Whey Protein™ and a scoop of [casein protein](../../micellar-casein.html "Casein protein"). With 9.2g protein per slice, it’ll keep you satisfied for hours and strong enough to fend off predators like ‘hunger’…

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 175C.

2.) Combine all of the ingredients together in a bowl, apart from the grated carrot. Blend together until smooth. Stir in the grated carrot. A nice addition would be some soaked, juicy sultanas!

3.) Line and lightly oil a 20cm square baking tin. Scrape the batter in, spread out and smooth.

4.) Pop in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes.

5.) Remove from the oven. Allow to cool slightly before removing from the tin. Cover with a tea towel and allow to cool on a wire rack.
