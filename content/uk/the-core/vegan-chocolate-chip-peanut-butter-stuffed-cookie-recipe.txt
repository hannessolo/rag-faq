Our friend Leah, aka [**The Hungry Welsh Girl**](https://thehungrywelshgirl.com/), has produced this mouth-watering **Vegan Chocolate Chip & Peanut Butter Stuffed Cookie** recipe. Using a handful of ingredients including our popular **Zero Calorie Syrup**™, **Roasted Peanut Butter** and **Quinoa Flour**, each cookie packs slow release carbs, healthy fats and a blast of protein.

What are you waiting for?

### Instructions:

1.) Pre-heat oven to 165c (fan assisted).

2.) Using a food processor, add half the rolled oats and blend into a flour/powder.

3.) Next add in the **Quinoa Flour**, sweetener, baking powder, vegan butter, **Zero Calorie Syrup**™ and the other half of the rolled oats and blend until a thick dough or batter forms, if it’s too wet add more **Quinoa Flour**.

NB: taste the cookie dough to test if it’s sweet enough.

4.) Knead or stir the chocolate chips into your dough.

5.) Now make the cookies. You can do this by scooping out the mixture with a spoon and flattening it on some grease proof paper, or you could mould into a tin, muffin tin, skillet, etc.

6.) Place half a tbsp **Peanut Butter** in the centre of your cookies, then place more cookie dough on top and close the sides with your finger.

7.) Bake for 10- 15 minutes at 165c (fan assisted) Remove from the oven and leave to cool.

8.) The cookies should be moist and crumbly. Enjoy!
