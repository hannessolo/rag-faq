For the launch of **1™**, [Complete Food Shake](https://www.bulk.com/uk/1-complete-food-shake.html), we sat down with our product team to find out more about this new formula. It’s a nutritious option to fit into busy routines and for anyone looking to cut down on cooked meals and potential waste. Read on to discover **1™.** 

For more info on the [benefits of a complete food shake](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/benefits-of-a-1-complete-food-shake/), see our other blog.

**What is 1™?** 
----------------

**1™** is a complete food shake. It combines a balanced ratio of [proteins](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/vegan-protein-powders-compared/), carbohydrates and fats in one convenient shake. In addition, it delivers nutrients from whole food sources such as **pea**, **pumpkin**, **flax**, **sweet potato**, **oats** and **coconuts**. **1™** also provides a whole host of vitamins and minerals, to satisfy your macros and micros.

### **Is 1™ Vegan?**

Yes, **1™** has been designed to be vegan friendly as well as gluten-free! It will be approved by the Vegan Society.

**What are the benefits of complete meal shakes?**
--------------------------------------------------

Convenience is a massive benefit for **1™**. You’ve simply got to mix it with water to get a healthy, balanced, nutritious shake. No cooking, washing up or burnt meals with **1™**. Being vegan friendly, it will also help to reduce your impact on the environment. Plus, it will minimise food waste – having a long shelf life, it can easily be consumed before the ‘Use By’ date without any skins, peels, or husks to throw away.

**What nutrients is my body getting from 1?**
---------------------------------------------

**1™** provides 30g of protein, 35g of carbohydrates and 12.6g of fat. On top of that, it contains 30% (or more) of your RDA for a wide spectrum of vitamins and minerals. We’ve also included some functional ingredients such as LactoSpore, DigeZyme, KSM-66 and Wellmune.

**How does 1™ support the immune system?**
------------------------------------------

**1™** contains a number of [vitamins and minerals](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/the-ultimate-guide-to-vitamins-and-minerals/) (such as vitamin D, vitamin C and vitamin B12) which contribute to the normal function of the immune system.

**How many times a day can you use 1™?**
----------------------------------------

It can be used 1-2 times a day, alongside a balanced diet.

**Why Ashwagandha?**
--------------------

We’ve included KSM-66 in this formula, which is a branded ingredient for of [Ashwagandha](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ashwagandha-capsules/bpb-ks66-0500). It has adaptogenic properties and that’s one of the reasons for selecting it. In addition, thanks to the Withania Somnifera content, it helps to maintain physical and mental capacities in cases of weakness, exhaustion, tiredness, and loss of concentration. Since many of our customers are constantly on the go, we thought this would be a beneficial ingredient to include for that specific reason.

**Tips for people trying a complete meal shake for the first time**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you’ve never used a product like **1™** before, it can seem a little alien at first. To help integrate it into your lifestyle, we’d suggest opting for either breakfast or lunch to start using the product. This allows you to still enjoy evening meals as usual. In addition, we’d suggest taking your time when drinking the shake. **1™** is quite filling, so downing it might not be the best. 

Finally, we suggest you gradually integrate it into your daily routine, perhaps for the first week, use it on workdays, or even every other day. Then you can start adding it to your daily routine both weekdays and weekends.
