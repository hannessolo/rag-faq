The basic principle of gaining mass is actually very simple: you need to consume more calories than you burn going about your daily activities. It does not matter how hard you train, if you are not eating enough, you will not put on muscle or weight. In this article we will be taking a look at what is required to gain mass from a nutritional perspective.

**Avoid Common Bulking Mistakes**
---------------------------------

When it comes to bulking, the aim is to put on as much muscle mass as possible. The issue is that when you are in a ‘bulking’ mindset, you can make a number of mistakes that could in fact be detrimental to your training.

### **The Problem with IIFYM/If It Fits Your Macros**

You may have heard of, or even currently be following the ‘If It Fits Your Macros’ approach, commonly abbreviated to IIFYM. This approach involves having relative freedom, eating whatever you want, providing it fits your macros. This means your protein and carbohydrates can come from any source you like.

The issue with this approach is that often people become so obsessed with the protein and carbohydrate content of the food they consume, they ignore other important nutrient values such as fat, sugar and salt content. This can lead to you putting on unwanted fat.

When increasing your calories, it is still important to pay close attention to what you are eating to consume the additional calories. Sticking to lean protein sources, slow releasing carbohydrates and low fat options will help to ensure you are working towards your goal of increased muscle mass.

**When to Use Mass Gainers**
----------------------------

It can be difficult to consume enough calories on a daily basis; especially with the busy lifestyle most people lead. In this circumstance it can be a good idea to supplement with a mass gainer. Using a mass gainer can help you increase your protein, carbohydrate and calorie intake quickly and effectively.

It is important to remember that [mass gainers](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/mass-gainers) are not a food replacement. They should be used in addition to a balanced diet as a good way of increasing your calorie intake if you are struggling to eat enough to consume the calories you require to gain weight.

**The Best Mass Gainer Supplements**
------------------------------------

When choosing a mass gainer, you want to choose a product that has a high protein content, high carbohydrate content and is therefore high in calories.

### INFORMED MASS®

A 150g serving of our premium mass gainer is packed with 45g of protein sourced primarily from whey isolate, over 74g of carbs sourced from Scottish oats and contains a total of 566 calories. [INFORMED MASS®](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/informed-mass/bpps-imas) is part of the BULK POWDERS® Pro Series™ range, meaning it uses the highest quality ingredients. As well as the high quality protein and carbohydrate sources used in this product, it also contains a number of other beneficial ingredients. These include:

*   Leucine, an essential amino acid for muscle growth
*   Creatine Monohydrate, which has been shown to increase physical performance when doing high intensity exercise
*   [HMB](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids/hmb.html), a substance that is necessary for metabolism
*   Glutamine Peptides, an amino acid used in the biosynthesis of proteins

In addition to the above, INFORMED MASS® contains DigeZyme®, a multi-enzyme complex which helps the body digest nutrients such as protein and carbohydrates. It also contains Lactospore®, a premium probiotic, which helps to stimulate the growth of good microorganisms, more commonly known as ‘good bacteria’.

### Complete Mass™

A 135g serving of [Complete Mass™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-mass-gainer/bble-cmas) is packed with 40.3g of protein, 66.4g of carbs and a total of 538 calories. It also contains important amino acids for muscle growth, such as leucine. Despite this product being slightly cheaper than INFORMED MASS®, do not think that this means a compromise on quality. High quality ingredients are used to provide the protein and carbohydrate, and there is no cheap added sugar, which is present in a number of other mass gainer products.

Complete Mass™ provides a blend of fast and slow release protein; sourced from whey concentrate, milk protein concentrate and egg white powder, meaning it’s a slow and fast release protein blend so that your muscles receive a rich supply of amino acids over an extended period of time. In addition, this mass gainer is available in a range of great flavours including chocolate, banana, strawberry and chocolate cookies, so you can find the best taste for you.

Complete Mass™ provides a highly cost effective way of adding additional calories to your diet.

If you’re concerned about the high amounts of calories and want to avoid unwanted fat, you could try Complete Lean Mass™. This is engineered to help towards the goal of increasing muscle mass without the additional calories.

**Eat More Calories, But Eat the Right Calories**
-------------------------------------------------

When your desire is to put on mass, it can be very easy to think of nothing more than consuming more calories. If you want to put on muscle mass, there is more to it than just eating whatever you want. Look to eat a balanced diet high in protein, healthy carbohydrates, and with a good amount of fruit and vegetables, and then look to weight gain supplements if you are struggling to consume enough calories from food sources alone.
