### Summary

Here’s a super tasty and great breakfast, or snack alternative, for people on the move. Peanut Butter & Chia Protein bars – packing over 14.8g of protein and 15.6g of healthy fats per bar!

### Instructions

1.) In a bowl, mix all your ingredients except for dark chocolate, [chia seeds](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/chia-seeds/bpf-chia "Chia seeds") and coconut oil. Add your peanut butter first, then the rest of your ingredients (easier to mix everything this way.) You should end up with a mouldable but soft dough.

2.) On a baking sheet/silicone mat mould your bars into the shapes that you desire; we went for the standard protein bar shape and got 8 pieces.

3.) Stick in the freezer and melt your chocolate with coconut oil in the meantime, either in microwave or bain marie.

4.) Take your bars out of freezer and coat evenly, we dipped them whole, however if you would like them to be more macro-friendly, use less chocolate and only coat them over the top.

5.) Sprinkle your chia over the top and place in fridge to set.

These were super tasty and a great breakfast alternative for those who are always on the go or don’t like eating much in the morning.
