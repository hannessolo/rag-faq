Supercharge your supplement stack in 2018 with these hidden gems!

If you’ve been training a while, you’ll already know about the benefits of supplement basics like [whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein.html), [fish oils](https://www.bulk.com/uk/health-wellbeing/fish-oils.html), and [vitamin D](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamin-d3-tablets-5000iu.html). But what about the lesser-known supplements that can help you burn more calories, train harder, and even build more muscle?

Let’s take a look at some of our more niche supplements – they might just take your results from good to great in 2018!

**1) Complete Probiotic™**
--------------------------

Digestive health looks set to hit the headlines again in 2018, with more research emerging about links between gut health and the brain. A healthy digestion means your body will be able to absorb more of the nutrients from food, and digest your protein and carbs more easily. [Complete Probiotic™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-probiotic.html) is an exclusive formulation with the exact amounts of each ingredient clearly listed, so you know exactly what is going in to your body.

### **What’s in it?**

Complete Probiotic™ has 5 strains of probiotics and nearly 8 billion CFUs (the measure used to quantify the useful bacteria in probiotics), plus digestive enzymes.

### **Try it if:**

– You’re bulking and eating a lot of food

– You ever experience bloating or digestive discomfort

– You want to optimise your gut health

**2) Cissus Quadrangularis**
----------------------------

This is a hot new supplement with a very long history in ancient cultures, where it has always been used in Ayurvedic medicinal approaches. Research suggests that this antioxidant has antiviral properties, and can help us recover from training, plus support good joint health in the long term.

### **What’s in it?**

The Cissus plant is commonly known as Veld Grape, and it contains plant sterols called ketosterones which are the active ingredient. Our [Cissus supplement](https://www.bulk.com/uk/usplabs-cissus-quadrangularis.html) is so fresh that you’ll often receive it 30 days after it was harvested in India.

### **Try it if:**

– Joint health is an ongoing concern

– You want to boost general wellbeing

– You would like to recover better from training

**3) Resveratrol**
------------------

Another exciting antioxidant with an increasing amount of research behind it, resveratrol is a natural plant phenol which is thought to help protect the body against damage. Resveratrol is a natural plant antioxidant found in red grapes, peanuts, betties, and the Japanese Knotweed Root.

### **What’s in it?**

The most important thing to look for in a [resveratrol supplement](https://www.bulk.com/uk/resveratrol-powder-99-trans-resveratrol.html) is purity and dosage – and ours is a guaranteed 99% Trans-Resveratrol (the active ingredient).

### **Try it if:**

– You want to reduce inflammation

– You are interested in plant antioxidants

– You want to boost overall general wellbeing

**4) Cinnamon Extract**
-----------------------

Cinnamon is already a fitness-fan favourite, so how about adding the pure extract to your supplement stack this year? Cinnamon extract has high levels of Terpenoids (much more concentrated than normal cinnamon powder) and our [Cinnamon Extract](https://www.bulk.com/uk/cinnamon-extract-powder.html) is a market leading 30:1 ratio!

### **What’s in it?**

100% Cinnamon Bark Extract Powder at a 30:1 extract ratio.

### **Try it if:**

– You like cinnamon

– You want to experiment with adding the powder to your shakes, smoothies, baking, or [oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html)

– You would like a natural way to balance and regulate blood sugar levels

**5) Tetradecylthioacetic Acid (TTA)**
--------------------------------------

TTA is a relatively new supplement (and we were the first to bring it to the UK market!) which is showing some promising signs for fat burning and diet support. Of course, like any fat burner, it can’t magically make you lean unless your calories are under control. But if your diet is in check, it could well be the final piece of the dieting puzzle!

### **What’s in it?**

TTA is a fatty acid (but actually has no calorific value) which can support fat burning and a fat loss diet.

### **Try it if:**

– Your goal is getting leaner and retaining muscle

– Your diet is already under control

– You want a fat burning product that isn’t a stimulant
