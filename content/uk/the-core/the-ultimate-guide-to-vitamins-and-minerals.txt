Vitamins and minerals play an essential role in helping the body to maintain normal daily function. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are associated with a vast number of negative side effects.

Alongside their obvious health benefits, vitamins and minerals are also important for physique development and performance. Specific vitamins and minerals are required for energy metabolism, hormone production and muscular contraction. Deficiencies in vitamins and minerals will prevent us from performing at our peak – which means we won’t get the most out of training sessions.

Here is our guide to [Vitamins and Minerals](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vitamins), the benefits they bring, and the food sources you can get them from.
