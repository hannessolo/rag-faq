Here at BULK POWDERS™ we’re continually expanding our product range to ensure that we’ve got products that are suitable for a wide range of goals. Occasionally, that can lead to products being introduced that appear similar but have subtle differences.

Two such products are [Complete All in One™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/complete-series/complete-all-in-one.html "Complete All In One Protein Powder") and [Complete Recovery™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/complete-series/complete-recovery.html "Complete Recovery Drink"). Below, we outline the key differences between them to help you choose which one to buy.

Complete All-In-One™
--------------------

### Key Features

Pure Whey Protein™, Maltodextrin, Leucine, Creatine Monohydrate, Leucine and Glutamine Peptides.

### Target consumer

Someone whose primary goals are to **increase muscle size and strength**. Complete All in One™ would typically be used immediately post-training.

Complete All in One™ contains more protein than carbohydrate, as well as Creatine Monohydrate and Leucine. The product has been designed to maximise post-training protein synthesis. While there is carbohydrate, recovering glycogen levels is less of a concern with resistance training (unless rest periods are short and it’s more of an interval training session).

Complete Recovery™
------------------

### Key Features

Pure Whey Protein Isolate™, Waxy Maize Starch, Leucine, HMB, L-Carnitine, Tart Cherry Extract, L-Glutamine, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C.

### Target consumer

Someone who has particularly **intense training sessions**, creating a lot of muscle damage. This may be an **endurance athlete** or someone who trains with a higher than average training frequency. If your goal is muscle building and you train with a high frequency, you may consider adding 5g Creatine Monohydrate per serving.

Complete Recovery™ has been formulated to aid recovery from exercise and to help relieve the symptoms of DOMS, so that you can continue to train with both frequency and intensity. Complete Recovery™ has more of a focus on **glycogen replenishment** than Complete All in One™, with a higher level of carbohydrate. Complete Recovery™ also has more of a focus on **reducing muscle damage**, with the inclusion of HMB, Tart Cherry Extract and Acetyl L-Carnitine.

Complete Recovery™ has been formulated so that it can be used as a single or double serving. The single serving gives all the appropriate dosages of performance ingredients, the double serving just gives that much extra – as well as increased carbohydrate and protein.

Summary
-------

While both products can be used for recovery and increasing muscle, it’s likely that Complete All in One™ is more suited to those that are resistance training 3-4 times per week and Complete Recovery™ is more suited to endurance athletes, team sport players and those with a higher training frequency.
