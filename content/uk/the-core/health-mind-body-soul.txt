Since many of us will be spending more time at home than usual, we’re letting you in on some top tips on how to look after not just your body but your mind, too.

**Make Time for You**

Whether working out is your thing or reading a book cleanses your soul, make yourself a priority for at least a couple of hours a week and you’ll notice the difference.

**Stretch it Out**

Guilty of not stretching after your workout? Now’s the time to change that! Not only stretching every day reduces muscle tension but increases circulation, raises energy levels and helps to keep your joints nice and healthy. So…what are you waiting for?

**Treat Yourself**

Whether it’s food or clothes, we all have our go-to favourites. Sometimes treating yourself to something special is the best way to get that endorphin rush, so get that card out!

**Give Back**

Whether it’s raising money for charity or helping a friend in need, giving a hand to the people that need it most will leave you feeling fulfilled. And who knows, you might even get some good karma in return.

**Try Something New**

Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone is, by definition, uncomfortable. But how else will you find a new passion or make new memories? Learning a new language or how to play an instrument can get you inspired. Plus, you might just find they stick.
