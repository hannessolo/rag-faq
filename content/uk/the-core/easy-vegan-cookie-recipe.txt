Vegan choc chips 

**Method:**

Preheat the oven to 180\*c

 Add everything to a large mixing bowl and mix

 Fold in chocolate chips or nuts at this point if desired (but they’re just as good without)

 Make small balls out of the mixture

 Place them on a lined baking tray and flatten with a fork

Bake for 10 mins

 Store them in an air-tight container to keep them fresher for longer
