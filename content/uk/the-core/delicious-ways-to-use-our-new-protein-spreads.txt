Protein. Chocolate. Nuts. This winning ingredient combination forms our new, delicious range of Protein Spreads. A creamy, no-added-sugar alternative to your regular supermarket-grade toast-topper. Packed with protein, our Protein Spreads stack up very favourably compared to the spreads you are probably used to. Made in small batches in the UK with zero palm oil, 22g protein per 100g and a huge amount of flavour. Each one is made with real nuts and features a blend of rapeseed, shea and coconut oils. Choose from a classic Chocolate Hazelnut, branch out with White Chocolate Hazelnut flavour or try something completely new with our delicious White Chocolate Pistachio flavour.

A great way to add protein and flavour to smoothies, as a spread over toast or pancakes and even straight from the spoon! We shared some with #TeamBulk foodie ambassador, [Nadia’s Healthy Kitchen](https://www.instagram.com/nadiashealthykitchen/?hl=en).
