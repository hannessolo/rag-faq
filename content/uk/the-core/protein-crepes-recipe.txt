Some say that he has the mating call of a killer whale and that he once counted to infinite…twice. All we know is he’s called The Beltsander.

Back with another tasty treat, these toffee popcorn crêpes deliver a mighty amount of protein whilst maintaining low carbs. The macro king comes up with the goods yet again.

### **Instructions**

1.) Make the crêpes by mixing the whey and egg whites in a shaker. Pour the mixture into a hot pan and tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.

2.) Cook the crêpes for about 2 minutes until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side.

3.) Make the filling by milking the set jelly and cottage cheese together and make the sauce by mixing the cocoa, sweetener and casein together and add the almond milk slowly until it reaches your desired consistency.
