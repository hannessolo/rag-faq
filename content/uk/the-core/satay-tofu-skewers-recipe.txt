Elke, Head Chef at [The Muscle Bakery](https://themusclebakery.com/), is known for her sweet tooth and all the cakes and bakes you could imagine. With lashings of Peanut Butter, here’s a Vegan treat you can enjoy when you feel like something more savoury.

**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.) Bring a pan of water to the boil, and put your block of tofu in for approx. 15 mins.

2.) Remove from the boil and slice into cubes of approx 2-3cm x 2-3cm and toss the pieces carefully in salt and tamari.

3.) Heat coconut oil in a non-stick pan on high heat as you essentially just want to ‘fry’ the edges.

4.) Add as many pieces as you can into pan without any pieces overlapping and leave it to sizzle, keep turning so that each of the edges end up browned.

5.) Place all the cubes onto a skewer and make your satay sauce.

**Satay Sauce:**

1.) Add water to a bowl and whisk in VitaFiber™ powder, then heat in the microwave for 30 seconds.

2.) Whisk again and heat for a further 30 seconds.

3.) Fold in Peanut Butter, then add remainder of ingredients.

4.) Then lather it on the skewers, sprinkle some chopped nuts over it (optional) and enjoy!
