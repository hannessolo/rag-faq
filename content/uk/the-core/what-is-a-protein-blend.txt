Not all protein is created equal, and not all health and fitness goals are the same. Subsequently, picking the right protein supplement can sometimes be confusing – as there’s typically more than a handful to choose between.

Our most popular protein supplement, [Pure Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000)™, is exactly that. It’s pure; an anti-blend if you like.

### **What does this mean?**

It’s a pure whey protein concentrate – containing no additional protein sources or added ingredients – besides the flavouring and colouring we add to make it taste so appetising.

Whilst Pure Whey Protein™ is a quality source of [milk protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/milk-protein), our training and lifestyles often dictate that we require additional supplement support, in the form of [amino acids](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids) and time-released protein, in order to maximise recovery and results.

As such, it might be worth considering a protein blend…

### **So what is a protein blend?**

A protein blend is any product or supplement that contains more than one protein source. This could be a combination of whey protein and whey protein isolate for example, or a blend of whey protein and casein, or egg protein.

### How does a protein blend compare to a Pure Whey Protein™?

In the table below, we’ve compared Pure Whey Protein™ against two of our popular protein blends, TRI-PRO™ (part of our Pro range) and [Complete Protein Blend](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-protein-blend/bble-cpbl)™.

### **Why use a protein blend?**

Protein blends contain multiple sources of protein and each of these proteins has their own unique amino acid profiles and rates of digestion. [Whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein) is naturally high in Leucine and is typically digested within 30 minutes. Egg white protein on the other hand is lower in Leucine, but higher in the amino acids Phenylalanine and Cystine, with a slower rate of digestion. Combined in a blend, you get the benefits of both.

Key benefits:

*   Often a combination of fast & slow-release proteins.
*   More diverse amino acid profiles.

Protein blends are great supplements for the sustained release of protein throughout the day, between meals, and before bed, when our bodies are most in need of amino acids to aid the rebuilding process.
