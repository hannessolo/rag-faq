If you fancy a Christmas pudding with a twist, this is the recipe for you! Elke, the esteemed owner of The Muscle Bakery, is feeling especially festive this year, so much so she’s created this enticing treat. **Protein Crispy Puds** are set to be the ‘must have’ gift this Christmas. Stock up on goodies like **[Casein](../../micellar-casein.html)** and **[VitaFiber](../../vitafiber-powder.html)™** and give the recipe a try yourself!

### Instructions:

1.) In a bowl whisk together agave and [**VitaFiber**](../../vitafiber-powder.html)**™** powder. Microwave for 30 seconds, whisk and then microwave for a further 30 seconds. If you would like to do this in a saucepan, do the same process except you just keep whisking while the saucepan heats up.

2.) Whisk in 1 Tbsp of the **Coconut Oil** and microwave for 30 seconds, then whisk in gelatine and microwave for a last 30 seconds.

3.) Melt 40g dark chocolate with remaining tbsp. of **Coconut Oil**, either in microwave or in a glass bowl over boiling water and whisk that into the mix.

4.) Fold in [**Casein**](../../micellar-casein.html), followed by rice crispies until well combined.

5.) Grab some muffin mold’s and press your mix evenly into each, fill to top to make less or make thinner ones to make them more macro-friendly. Up to you! Place in fridge until hardened.

**Topping:**

Whisk together egg white and vinegar until fluffy, then add Sukrin Icing by spoonful until you get a thick texture, thick enough to run over the sides of your ‘pud’ but not too runny or else it’ll just end up being a mess.

Remove hardened ‘pud’ bases from fridge.

With a spoon add topping mix carefully to the top of your pud, pushing excess mix over the edge carefully with the back of your spoon.

Repeat until all puds are done.
