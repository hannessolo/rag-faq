Messi vs Ronaldo. Nadal vs Federer. [Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-whey-isolate/bpb-cwhe) vs [Whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein?page=1&pageSize=15&sort=position&sortDirection=asc). It’s the debate that’s taking over the protein industry, and we’re doing a deep dive into which is the better form of [protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein?page=1&pageSize=15&sort=position&sortDirection=asc). 

Well, not really. But we are going to look at the _differences_ between clear whey and whey.

Discover whether you’re a fan of thick, creamy shakes or if you prefer a crisper, more refreshing taste. This is clear whey isolate vs whey protein.

**What’s the difference between clear whey and whey protein?**
--------------------------------------------------------------

There are many differences. Clear Whey Isolate is refreshing, light and crisp, and is made with fruity flavours. Whey is thicker, creamier and has a variety of flavours – ranging from the simplicity of Vanilla to the extravagance of Cinnamon Cereal Milk. 

As mentioned above, Clear Whey has a finer powder, which creates a lighter, crisper texture. Whey maintains that thick, creamy shake.

In one sentence: Clear Whey is like fruit juice, while Whey Protein is like milkshake.

**What is clear whey isolate?** 
--------------------------------

[Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-whey-isolate/bpb-cwhe) is tipped to become the future of protein powders. More people are choosing the crisp freshness as their go-to drink after a workout, a training session or just to sip on throughout the day.

But you’re probably wondering, [what is clear whey?](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/introducing-clear-whey-isolate/) 

Basically, it’s squash with protein. It’s formulated with a much finer powder than regular protein, which creates a lighter, clearer texture. 

That light texture – alongside the fruity flavours and fresh taste – resembles a fruit juice that packs at least 20g of protein into every glass. Unsurprisingly, it’s also very low on calories and sugar. Ideal if you’re cutting.

**What is whey concentrate (or ‘normal’ whey)?**
------------------------------------------------

[Whey protein concentrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pure-whey-protein/bpb-wpc8-0000) is the most popular and recognisable protein powder.

You’ve probably had it, seen others at the gym drink it, and your mates who have never stepped foot in the gym have probably had a sip at some point. 

It’s firmly established as the go-to protein drink.

The formula stems from the proteins isolated from whey, the byproduct of cheese production. For a plant-based alternative, [vegan protein powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-powder/vser-vppo) is made with plants but replicate the creamy texture. 

**What’s the difference between whey protein and whey isolate?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

[Whey isolate vs whey protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/which-whey-to-gains-concentrate-vs-isolate/#heading-3) is another question we often get.

Whey protein isolate is very similar to whey protein, except it’s gone through some extra filtration processes. Some of the fats, carbs and lactose get removed, which creates a higher concentration of protein and lower calories. 

In a nutshell, if you’re super diligent about counting macros or you’re going through a cut, you’re best with whey isolate.

**What about clear whey isolate and clear whey protein?**
---------------------------------------------------------

The difference is similar to whey protein and whey isolate. Clear Whey Isolate contains a much lower amount of carbs, calories and fats – ideal if you’re looking to cut. 

Unlike Clear Whey Isolate, [Clear Whey All In One](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/clear-all-in-one/bble-cwa1) contains 29g European whey protein, 17g high-quality carbs, 3g creatine monohydrate, 3g l-glutamine and 8g BCAAs. It has everything you need in that post-workout period.

**And whey protein vs mass gainer?**
------------------------------------

Both products help you put on muscle, but which is more effective: [Whey protein or Mass Gainer](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/whey-protein-vs-mass-gainer/)? The answer depends on what results you want to achieve.

The main difference between the two is that [Mass Gainer](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-mass-gainer/bble-cmas) tends to suit those on bulking programme. It’s a thick shake that contains a large amount of calories and carbohydrates, alongside the huge protein content. A whopping 43g.

Whey protein predominantly contains just protein, which suits calorie maintenance or even a calorie deficit. It’s a slightly thinner shake than Mass Gainer, great if you’re looking to add more protein to your diet.

Whey protein is recommended for those looking to [build and maintain muscle mass](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8075117/), or on a cut. Mass Gainer is exclusively recommended for those on a bulk, or trying to gain weight.
