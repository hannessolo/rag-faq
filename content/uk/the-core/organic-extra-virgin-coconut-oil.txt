Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil:
---------------------------------

[Coconut oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/organic-virgin-coconut-oil/bpf-ovco) is extracted from the kernel or meat of fresh and matured coconuts harvested from the coconut palm. We use the extra virgin grade oil which is obtained naturally and not leached, deodorised or refined, which leads to modification of the oil.

What is Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil?
-----------------------------------------

Our [Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/organic-virgin-coconut-oil/bpf-ovco "Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil") is white and solid at room temperature. Unlike other saturated fats, coconut oil is composed of around 66% Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) providing an energy source for the body, rather than being stored as fat. Slower to oxidise and less damaged by heat than other cooking oils, it is arguably the healthiest oil to cook with.

What does it do?
----------------

Health:

Antioxidant:

Coconut oil has links to the prevention of cell damage, which causes a variety of diseases such as cancer, ageing and heart diseases etc.

‘The strong antioxidant capacity in coconut oil is predominantly due to the two particular compounds, ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid, making it a good source to prevent free radical damage to the body.’

Together, these phenolic compounds are accountable for over 80% of the antioxidant capacity of Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil due to their powerful synergistic effect when together:

*   Ferulic acid can help reduce inflammation, regulate blood sugar levels, protects the liver and help lower blood pressure.
*   p-Coumaric acid lowers LDL cholesterol and prevents plaque build-up in the arteries.

Skin:

Coconut oil is also seen in the beauty industry, acting as a skin moisturiser and protecting the skin from free radicals, leading to premature ageing.

Performance:

Weight Loss:

Many people use coconut oil instead of carbohydrates to fuel their workout, giving them a great energy boost. Research has suggested that with taking 1-2 tablespoons may help to buffer insulin-spikes that would otherwise promote body fat storage, making coconut oil likely to play a role in weight loss. MCTs have also been widely compared to olive oil, coming out on top with regards to enhancing weight loss.

Energy Production:

Adding coconut oil into your diet can keep your energy high whilst you stay lean. After digesting coconut oil, it will go directly to the liver before being transformed into energy.

Quantity and timing:
--------------------

Although there is no recommendation on consumption quantity of coconut oil, it is a fat and should therefore be used in moderation.

You can use Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil as an MCT addition to your homemade protein shakes or as it is heat stable, use it to cook a stir fry, quickly blast it in the microwave and drizzle on a salad. Or if you are feeling more adventurous try baking with it in some protein flapjacks/muffins.
