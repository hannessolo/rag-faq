**From Art teacher in Oldham to bikini competitor and now health-and-fitness guru, Sophie’s friendly face, bubbly personality and relatable content has gained her over half a million Instagram followers. We sat down with our brand-new ambassador to find out more about her journey into the fitness world.**

**When did you first get into fitness?**

About six years ago I started going to the gym, but I would just stay on the cross trainer for 30 minutes and read a magazine because I was so intimidated by the weights area.

Then, I started dating someone who competed in [bodybuilding competitions](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/competing-this-year-read-this-first/) and learnt more about nutrition and started lifting weights. I went along to one of his competitions and I remember thinking the women on stage in the bikini competition were incredible! I said to myself the year after I would be up on that stage. I went on to win the UKBFF North West Championships two years running after that.

**What made you realise you didn’t want to compete anymore?**

It was my mum – she didn’t like me doing the competitions. She told me after one competition that I was losing friends as I would never go out and socialise. It just clicked after that that I wasn’t healthy and happy.

**How do you approach your health now?**

I’m totally flexible with my eating and I don’t track my calories or macros on an app anymore.

It’s about finding a weight you feel confident and comfortable with – I’m now 10kg heavier than when I competed, but so much happier in my own skin.

**How do you look after your mental health?  
**  
I’ve really started to make my mental health a priority this year. Like many people my mental health is up and down, but that’s the world we live in today. I’ve come to learn that happiness isn’t a given, it’s something you have to work on every day.  
**  
What are your goals for the rest of 2019?**

I want to go into schools to talk about social media and how to build a brand. I think it’s really important that kids learn early on about the reality of the internet and social.

**What are your favourite Bulk products?**

Every day I mix the [Vegan Series Protein Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/shop-by-range/vegan-protein-supplements) in with [oats](https://www.bulk.com/uk/ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html) and berries for breakfast. I love the white chocolate and coconut flavour. Most days I’ll have the cookies and cream [Macro Munch](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-bar-V2/mmun-pbar-v2), too. It’s so delicious!
