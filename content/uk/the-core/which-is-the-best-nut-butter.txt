Nutty about protein? Don’t spread yourself too thin. Along with the much-loved classics like **[Peanut Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut)**, we now have three completely new products in our range of nut butters – Flavoured Cashew Butter, Duo Protein Spread and Peanut Butter Powder. Let’s see if we can find the best fit for your training (and taste buds).

Benefits of Nut Butters
-----------------------

Put simply, **[nut butters](https://www.bulk.com/uk/foods/nut-butters)** are an easy and delicious way to increase your protein content – most of our nut butters and protein spreads are classified as containing sources of protein. Many of our butters are also high in fibre, which helps to curb those cravings and sustain energy throughout your workout.

Only naturally occurring sugars are found in our nut butters and spreads. This means you aren’t incorporating unnecessary sugars into your diet, which is a common issue with many mainstream spreads currently sold in supermarkets. Another issue with supermarket spreads is that they contain palm oil. Our nut butters and protein spreads are free from palm oil, allowing you to make the sustainable choice.

Our nut butters are versatile. They can be used to add protein to a variety of dishes throughout the day – from dolloping into a warm bowl of porridge, adding some extra flavour to your protein shakes or including in sauce recipes for evening meals. And if bulking is your goal, consuming nut butters is a great way to help you.

*   Great taste with a smooth, buttery texture
*   Most of our nut butters and spreads contain a source of protein
*   Fibre content helps to keep cravings under control
*   The sustainable choice of spread – palm oil free
*   Versatile – a great addition to any meal/shake
*   Great for bulking, or any mass gain programme

**Peanut butter**
-----------------

Top of the list is our [**Peanut Butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/peanut-butter-1kg/bpf-pbut), also known as the king of all nut butters. A rich, natural butter produced from 100% roasted whole peanuts and nothing else. It contains 28g protein per 100g and has no added sugar or salt. It’s also the perfect butter for bulking. It can be used as a dip, in a sauce, in a protein shake or simply spread on toast. Check out our recipe blogs, such as this [**Peanut Butter Noodle Recipe**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/peanut-butter-noodles/), for great ways to incorporate this simple spread into delicious meals.

We have also introduced our new [**Powdered Peanut Butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/powdered-peanut-butter/bpf-pbpd) into the range. This is a great option for someone who loves the taste of peanut butter, but isn’t so keen on the idea of bulking, and would prefer to go for a lower calorie and lower fat version. This powder contains 70% less fat than traditional peanut butter and is much higher in protein, containing 48g protein per 100g. This powder is ideal for adding to smoothies and protein shakes and is very easy to mix in. Alternatively, you can add water to the powder until you’ve reached your desired consistency, and it can be used as a standard nut butter spread from there.

If you fancy a twist on the classic peanut butter, our [**Flavoured Peanut Butters**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/flavoured-peanut-butters/bpf-pbut-flav) are definitely worth a try. They have all the same health benefits as our standard peanut butter.

**Almond butter**
-----------------

Our [**Almond Butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/roasted-almond-butter/bpf-abut) is also a great choice for bulking up, while being high in fibre and low in sugar. Our Dark Chocolate Almond Butter is a great option if you’re looking for something more indulgent and works well in baking recipes, such as our recipe for these macro-friendly sweet treats, [**Chocolate Almond Doughnuts**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/chocolate-almond-protein-doughnuts/).

**Cashew butter**
-----------------

If you’re looking for a smoother and more creamy nut butter, this [**Cashew butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/cashew-butter/bpf-cbut) is the one for you. It’s both low in sugar and offers a source of protein. Again, it can be used for bulking. It’s smooth texture makes it perfect for mixing in with porridge, and if you fancy a little more flavour, check out our new **[Flavoured Cashew Butter](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/flavoured-cashew-butter/bpf-cbut-flav)**. It’s a new favourite in the Bulk office. 

**Hazelnut butter**
-------------------

For the hazelnut fans out there, we have a number of choices for you. Our [**Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/dark-chocolate-hazelnut-butter/bpf-hbut-dcho) is our alternative to Nutella®. It contains 75% less sugar and has no palm oil, making it the sustainable choice.

As well as our standard [**Hazelnut Butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hazelnut-butter/bpf-hbut) and Dark Chocolate Hazelnut Butter, we have a new addition to the range – our [**Duo Protein Spread**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/protein-spreads/bpf-pspr). A mesmerising mixture of milk and white chocolate hazelnut spread, it tastes as good as it looks. It’s lower in fat than our nut butters, has no added sugar and contains 19g protein per 100g. 

**Pistachio butter**
--------------------

An Italian favourite, our [**Pistachio Butter**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/pistachio-butter/bpf-pisb) isn’t one to miss. It has a particularly strong fibre content of 8.4g per 100g, which can lead to an increased feeling of fullness. As with the other nut butters, it can also be helpful for bulking. Try it in our delicious recipe for [**Pistachio Protein Pasta**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/pistachio-pesto-pasta/).
