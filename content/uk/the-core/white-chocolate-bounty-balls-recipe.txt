### Summary

Fancy something a little bit naughty, before something a little bit naughty? Try this White Chocolate Bounty Balls recipe for a treat that will satisfy your cravings before the ‘main course’…

### Instructions

1.) Add BULK POWDERS™ [dried coconut](../../dried-coconut.html "Dried Coconut") to a food processor and process until finely ground (to make desiccated coconut). Add 12g of this to a heated frying pan and toast until golden.

2.) Combine the other dry ingredients together.

3.) Melt the [coconut oil](../../organic-virgin-coconut-oil.html "Coconut Oil") in a bowl. Add the almond milk. Add the dry ingredients and toasted coconut and mix well until it comes together. If it’s a little too sticky, add a touch more coconut flour. Divide and roll into 8 balls.

4.) Melt your chocolate. Drop each ball into the chocolate and coat. Leave to set on a piece of greaseproof paper, adding any optional toppings whilst the chocolate is still melted.
