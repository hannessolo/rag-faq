[Protein snacks](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/protein-snacks). Great for when you’re on the go. But are they worth the hype? The short answer is yes. Of course we’d say that. Because we have a fine selection. All made with your taste buds and busy schedules in mind. 

They come in many shapes and sizes. Offering a little guilt-free sweetness, protein snacks are a smart way to supplement your healthy lifestyle. See them as a helping hand in reaching your protein goals. No measuring. No cooking. No prep. 

But with so many on the market, where do you start? It’s easy to get lost, and we’re here to help you out. A bit like speed dating for protein bars. And hopefully we’ll set you up with the perfect match. 

**Protein Balls**
-----------------

Let’s start with something a little different. And brand new this week. Our **[Protein Balls](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/protein-balls/bpf-pbal)** are a protein snack like no other. Made with a few simple, high quality ingredients rolled into bite-sized balls of goodness. Dates, nuts and at least 8g plant protein per packet, and with no added sugar. If you’re looking for a more natural product with a soft texture and nutty taste, these are for you. Available in Chocolate Coconut, Lemon Drizzle and Peanut Butter Cookie Dough. 

**MACRO MUNCH™ Protein Bar**
----------------------------

Our flagship protein bar for a reason. Packed with flavour, 20g protein and low in sugar. Available in nine flavours, each [protein bar](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/protein-bars) is triple layered with a soft-baked centre, caramel and rich chocolate. If you haven’t tried one, I highly recommend the **Salted Caramel** flavour. A classic combination of sweet and salty.

**Gourmet Vegan Bar**
---------------------

New for 2022, this is our vegan answer to the MACRO MUNCH™ Protein Bar. Packed with 16g plant protein and low in sugar, our **[Gourmet Vegan Bar](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/gourmet-vegan-bar/vser-vgba)** is a triple-layered taste sensation. If you’re following a vegan diet, or looking to lower your dairy intake, this is the ultimate snacking choice.

**Protein Flapjacks**
---------------------

One of our best-selling snacks. A rich all-butter flapjack that’s soft in texture and full of flavour. Each of our **[Protein Flapjacks](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/fruity-protein-flapjack/bpf-frfl)** contains an impressive 20g protein and is made with oats – a great form of slow release carbs. If you’re looking for a slightly more substantial and higher calorie snack, this one’s for you.  

**Vegan Protein Brownie**
-------------------------

I’m not vegan, but I love our **[Vegan Protein Brownie](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vegan-protein-brownie/vser-vpbr)**. Each delivers 15g protein in a soft, cake-like (almost gooey) brownie format. If you’re ingredient conscious, and looking to lower your dairy intake, you’ll love these. 

We also do a **[Vegan Protein Blondie](https://www.bulk.com/uk/catalogsearch/result/?q=vegan+blondie)**, which has the same great nutrition and texture. Our new Salted Caramel flavour is my go-to. (Seeing a pattern with my favourites?)

**Protein Millionaires Slice and Protein Rocky Road**
-----------------------------------------------------

Now we’re heading into the realm of indulgence. You wouldn’t even know these are protein snacks. Our [**Protein Millionaires Slice**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-bar-V2/mmun-pbar-v2) contains 15g protein and features an oaty base, luxurious caramel layer and chocolate flavoured coating. See your sweet cravings cured with this one. 

**Protein Cookie**
------------------

Our **[Protein Cookie](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/high-protein-cookies/bpf-hpco)** is your next level protein snack, with a serious 27g protein per cookie. The ultimate snack for hitting those protein goals. A cake-like texture and rich in flavour, this satisfying snack reaches new heights. Each flavour combines delicious chocolate with a fruity tang. The only decision you have to make is which one. Chocolate Orange or White Chocolate & Raspberry?

**MACRO MUNCH™ Protein Peanut Butter Cups**
-------------------------------------------

Another new addition for 2022, our **MACRO MUNCH™ Protein Peanut Butter Cups** are beautifully balanced with creamy peanut butter and a thick layer of protein milk chocolate. Each cup has 6.5g protein and is low in sugar. A melt-in-the-mouth dream of a protein snack. Perfect if you’re looking for a light, on-the-go bite.

**MACRO MUNCH™ Protein Biscuits**
---------------------------------

These are crunchy little numbers. Two layers of crisp biscuit with a creamy vanilla centre. Try dunking **MACRO MUNCH ™ Protein Biscuits** in a cup of tea, or your favourite protein shake, for a tasty contribution to your daily protein intake.

**A snack to suit you**
-----------------------

So as you can see, every protein snack has a place. It’s completely down to personal preference, such as flavour, texture, format, diet and training goals. With such a wide choice, we know there’s something for you. 

Getting that extra hit of protein can really make the difference to your day. Whether you want to curb the sweet cravings (guilt-free), or bump up your protein intake in a quick and convenient way, protein snacks really are worth the hype.

Our protein snacks are created to supplement a healthy diet and an active lifestyle. Remember to always follow the guidelines on the packet.
