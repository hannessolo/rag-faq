The climatologists are telling us that we should stay inside because the #heatwave is dangerous. We say get outside, enjoy the vitamin D3 and suck on a Blueberry Lemon Popsicle. A summer recipe using our Lemon Meringue flavour Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ that even a 2 year old could make. Try it!

### **Instructions**

1.) Add all the ingredients to your blender

2.) Whiz it up

3.) Pour it into your ice-cream lolly moulds

4.) Freeze for 2-3 hours

Alternatively, you can eat as is, straight from the blender! It will taste like soft serve ice-cream, if there ever was a fresh blueberry lemon flavour!

Recipe yields 8 Blueberry Lemon Popsicles.

### GET FREEZING!
