Olympia 2015 is upon us with controversy surrounding the exclusion of the people’s champion Kai Greene. We’re gutted for Kai who will have put in so much hard prep to get ready for the big day. But who knows what has gone on behind the scenes? Maybe we’ll never really find out.

But the show must go on. Will it be Phil Heath’s year yet again or will someone like Big Ramy, Shawn Rhoden or Dennis Wolf take the Sandow trophy? Will Branch Warren come roaring back? Or could it be a big outsider?

To celebrate the Olympia weekend, we’re giving YOU the chance to win a big prize as we marvel at big physiques – a **BULK POWDERS™ Olympia Special Bundle with prizes worth over £150!**

Simply **predict the Top 3 for Mr Olympia 2015** across one of our social media channels to confirm your entry. Full details about how to enter can be found below.

How we’ll pick the winner
-------------------------

Firstly we’ll look to see who has given the correct prediction for the top 3 in the correct order. From these entries, we’ll pick one person at random to win the prize.

If no-one gets the right order, we’ll take all entries who get the top 3 correct in ANY order and pick the winner at random.

Entries will be collated from across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The winner will be announced next week across all our social media pages.

Good luck!
