Heather, aka [Protein Chef](http://proteinchef.co.uk/), received a bundle of products including our [Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)™, [Ultra Fine Scottish Oats](../../ultra-fine-scottish-oats.html) and **Liquid Egg Whites**. She wanted to create something warming to heat her up on a cold day, and nothing beats a warm sponge pudding covered in hot, sweet custard!

Heather has created a high protein, healthier version of the tummy warming pud and it goes by the name of ‘**Protein Sponge Pudding with Protein Custard**‘.

Here’s how she made it:

### Method

1.) For this recipe all you need to do is whisk all of the cake ingredients together, adding the water little by little until the mixture resembles pancake mixture.

2.) Pour this batter into a plastic microwave safe bowl and microwave on full power for 1.30 minutes (if you have an old or not very powerful microwave you might need to cook it for slightly longer)

3.) Whilst the cake cooks add a splash of boiling water to the custard powder to make a paste. Keep adding little by little until you end up with a smooth custard.

4.) Add the [**whey** **protein**](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein.html) and give it a good stir to remove any lumps. You may need to add a touch more water but this entirely depends on the brand of custard powder you are using as some require more water than others.

5.) Take the cake out of the microwave and turn it out onto a plate, pour over the hot custard and enjoy! I like to eat mine with a spoonful of jam (sugar free if you wish).
