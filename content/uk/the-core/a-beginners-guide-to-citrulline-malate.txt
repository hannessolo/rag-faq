Citrulline is one of the most popular inclusions in pre-workout drinks, like [ELEVATE](https://www.bulk.com/uk/elevate.html)™, often combined with supplements like [L-Arginine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/l-arginine.html) and [Beta Alanine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/beta-alanine.html). The primary dietary source of Citrulline is Watermelon; in fact, the name is derived from the Latin for Watermelon, Citrullus. However, dietary intake is practically insignificant, hence why supplementation can be beneficial.

**WHAT IS CITRULLINE MALATE?**
------------------------------

Citrulline Malate combines the amino acid citrulline with malate, an organic salt. It plays a role in numerous biochemical reactions within muscle tissue.

**WHY SHOULD I TAKE IT?**
-------------------------

If you’re looking to increase performance capacity in the gym or when you train, it is believed to positively impact a number of key biological processes, including:

Reducing Lactic Acid and Ammonia Buildup.

When we train – whether we run, lift heavy weights, or attack a spin class – our bodies produce ammonia and other toxic by-products. A build-up of these by-products leads to a reduction in athletic performance. It plays an important role in the Urea Cycle, helping to eliminate these by-products, increasing your ability to maintain performance and fight off muscle fatigue.

Greater Nitric Oxide Production.

Supplementation of Citrulline Malate is shown to increase Arginine levels in the body, which supports the production of Nitric Oxide. This in turn has benefits like increasing blood flow, oxygen transportation and nutrient uptake, as well as assisting muscle functions for improved output and growth.

Supports the ATP System for Prolonged Output.

It is believed that supplementing with this amino acid can also assist athletes by increasing aerobic energy production – allowing you to reach higher endurance thresholds. There is also evidence of improved phosphocreatine recovery, post-exercise.

**WHEN SHOULD I TAKE IT?**
--------------------------

Citrulline Malate is best taken on an empty stomach for optimal absorption. On exercise days we would recommend taking one serving first thing in the morning and another serving 30-40 minutes prior to exercise.

**HOW MUCH SHOULD I TAKE?**
---------------------------

We recommend taking 3.0g-5.0g per serving, 1-2 times daily. Our 5ml measure (level scoop) provides approximately 2.6g of [Citrulline Malate powder](http://A Beginner’s Guide to Citrulline Malate). We therefore recommend using 1-2 scoops per serving depending on your preference.
