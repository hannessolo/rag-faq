Looking for a delicious and satisfying plant-based meal idea? Look no further than this Ultimate Cheeseburger recipe from Lucy Watson’s cookbook Feed Me Vegan.

It’s a common misconception to think that plant-based diets are low in protein but, grains and pulses have lots of it. In fact, these burgers are mostly made of lentils and chickpeas so you’re in for a great meal packed with protein. Plus, we’ve put our Bulk Powders spin on it and you’ll probably recognise some tasty ingredients from our Active Foods range.

Ingredients (4 burgers):
------------------------

*   15 sprays Bulk Powders 1 Calorie Extra Virgin Olive Oil
*   1 onion, finely diced
*   2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
*   1 tsp ground cumin
*   1 tsp [Bulk Powders Himalayan Pink Salt](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/himalayan-pink-salt/bpf-psal-hima)
*   2 tsp hickory liquid smoke
*   1 red pepper, deseeded and diced
*   400g canned chickpeas drained and rinsed
*   40g [Bulk Powders Ultra Fine Oat](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/ultra-fine-scottish-oats/bpb-oats-0000)
*   250g cooked Puy lentils from a can or pack (drained if from a can)
*   50g plain flour
*   4 slices vegan Cheddar cheese
*   Freshly ground black pepper

### To serve:

*   4 wholemeal burger buns, halved and toasted
*   Vegan mayonnaise
*   8 Little Gem lettuce leaves
*   Ketchup
*   2 dill pickles, sliced thickly
*   American mustard
*   French fries

Method:
-------

*   Heat 15 sprays of oil in a non-stick frying pan over high heat.
*   Add the onion and cook for 3-4 minutes or until soften and translucent.
*   Add the garlic and red pepper and cook for 4 minutes.
*   Stir in the cumin and salt, cook for 1 minute and then remove from heat.
*   Leave to cool.
*   Put the onion mixture in a food processor, followed by the liquid smoke and chickpeas.
*   Pulse until the mixture is combined but not smooth – to retain some texture.
*   Transfer this mixture to a large bowl.
*   Put the oats into the cleaned food processor and blend until they resemble a coarse flour.
*   Add this to the bowl followed by the cooked lentils.
*   Mix well and season with black pepper and cajun.
*   Divide the mixture into 4 equal burgers and transfer to the fridge to rest for 2-3 hours until firm.
*   Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan, gas 6).
*   Sprinkle the flour over the burgers on both sides.
*   Dust off any excess flour.
*   Heat the remaining oil in a non-stick frying pan over high heat.
*   Add the burgers and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until browned.
*   Transfer to a baking tray and cook in the oven for 5 minutes.
*   Remove from the over, add a slice of vegan cheese to each burger and put them back in the oven for 2-3 minutes until the cheese has melted.
*   Spread each bun with some vegan mayonnaise.
*   Put 2 lettuce leaves on the bottom half of each bun.
*   Top with the burger, ketchup, dill pickles, more mayo and the mustard.
*   Serve with hot, crispy fries.
