We already know that [creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine) is not just one of the most widely used (and researched) supplements. We also know that it works. But there’s still the question of creatine loading. Should you have a creatine loading phase, or should you skip it? 

**How does creatine work?**
---------------------------

In terms of [what creatine does](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/beginners-guide-to-creatine/), creatine is a natural compound which is found in meat, fish and animal products (and in our own muscle tissue). Taken as a supplement, creatine increases the stores of cellular phosphocreatine, which can accelerate the recycling of ADP into ATP, making more energy available for high-intensity exercise. 

In simple terms: more creatine stores = more rapid energy. By supplementing with creatine, you are maximising your high-intensity energy output. 

There are other [benefits of creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/benefits-of-taking-creatine/) too. Creatine can also boost cell fullness (aka “the pump”), help with recovery and improve performance in explosive sports.

**What is a creatine loading phase?**
-------------------------------------

A creatine loading phase involves taking a higher dose than the maintenance for several days. This is around 10-15 g rather than the recommended maintenance dose of 3-5g. This enables you to maximise your creatine storage as quickly as possible, and begin reaping the performance benefits of creatine sooner.

**Do you need to load creatine?**
---------------------------------

People are split on this. Some studies suggest that creatine stores can be increased without a loading dose \[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5753968/#bibr6-1941738117737248)\]. A commonly accepted loading dose regimen is 20 to 25 grams per day, divided 4 times daily for 5 to 7 days \[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5753968/#bibr10-1941738117737248)\].

By skipping the creatine loading phase, it may just take a bit longer to maximise your muscle stores of creatine – and therefore a bit longer to see the beneficial effects of creatine. It’s as simple as that.

Larger people need a higher dose of creatine anyway, so the idea of adjusting dosage is normal, even it is beyond the universal recommendation of 3-5g per day.

On the whole, creatine is safe and cost-effective, and a creatine loading strategy will not disrupt this. Some people respond better than others to creatine supplementation. You won’t know until you try, so perhaps it’s worth doing on your next creatine cycle.

**How to creatine load**
------------------------

Creatine loading only works if you are beginning a new creatine cycle, whether that’s for the first time or tenth time. (A creatine cycle is where you take creatine everyday for 12 weeks, have a short break, then return to taking it again. It avoids desensitisation to the supplement).

If your maintenance dose is 5 grams of creatine per day, you could try loading on 5g four times per day for seven days. This equals 20g per day for one week. Spread those doses throughout the day, and take them with carbohydrate dense meals or snacks. You should also increase your water intake slightly during this creatine loading phase to avoid dehydration

After this loading week, move to a regular daily dose (3-5 grams per day). If you feel like 20g is too much for you, calculate your loading intake by body weight. 0.3g creatine per kilo of body weight is a good guide. 

**What type creatine should you take for creatine loading?**
------------------------------------------------------------

It doesn’t really matter. But since you’ll be taking larger quantities, most people would find it easy to take [Creatine Monohydrate Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate/bpb-cmon-0000) rather than [Creatine Monohydrate Tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate-tablets-1000mg/bpb-cmon-tabs). Consuming 20 tablets a day may be challenging for some.

Whilst creatine loading is necessary to build up your creatine is not essential for creatine supplementation, it is a safe and easy way to reap the benefits as soon as possible.
