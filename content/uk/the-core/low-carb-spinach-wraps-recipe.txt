Wrap your tongue around these delicious low carb spinach wraps. Heed the advice of the Muscle Baker and cook on a low to medium heat, otherwise your meal will fail and we’ll send the dogs round to clean up.

Each wrap has less than 5g carbs and over 20g protein!

No spinach leaves to hand? Replace with our [spinach powder](../../spinach-powder.html).

### Method:

1\. Add all ingredients to a blender and blitz away until well combined.  
2\. Heat up a non-stick pan\* on low/medium heat. (wait until it is hot before pouring batter onto it).  
3\. Pour batter as preferred; if you want to make large wraps like shown use more batter, if you want smaller ones use less.

Let the pancake ‘wrap’ bake enough before flipping over, if not it will break.  
Do NOT try and be clever and cook it on higher heat because you are impatient, this will burn it too quick and you’ll be left with a mess.

Repeat x3 (or more if making smaller ones).

\*We recommend buying a ceramic pan, they cook recipes like this perfectly without the use of any oil.
