Happy **[International Women’s Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/)**. On the 8th March, for over one hundred years, we have been recognising and celebrating the achievements of women across the globe.

This year’s theme, **#EmbraceEquity**, shines a spotlight on the importance of striving for fairness and impartiality in order to create an inclusive world. We can all challenge gender stereotypes, call out discrimination, draw attention to bias and seek out inclusion. A message that certainly resonates in the fitness world.

We extended the conversation to our female ambassadors who shared their thoughts on their place as women in the fitness industry. Through an open dialogue we can all work together to **#EmbraceEquity** in fitness spaces.

**The Ambassadors**
-------------------

We chatted to **[Sara Britton](https://www.instagram.com/sbritt_fitt/)**, **[Karii London](https://www.instagram.com/kariilondon/)**, **[Alessia Fantini](https://www.instagram.com/_thevegansideofthemoon/?hl=en)** and **[Sarah Jane Lees](https://www.instagram.com/_sarahlfit/?hl=en).** These women have all overcome their own form of bias and discrimination to find their place in the fitness world. 

**What’s the best thing about being a woman in fitness in 2023?** 
------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sarah B:** For me, it’s that women can challenge the gender stereotypes and masculine hegemony often found in this industry. We can present a healthy, positive body image showing that women are strong, confident and just as able to succeed in sports and fitness.

**Alessia:** The best thing for me is going beyond my limits. 

**Sarah Jane:** Same here. I’m super competitive. 

**Karii:** I love that we can embrace exactly who we are. There are so many different types of women with different body shapes and sizes doing exactly what they love. 

**Sarah B:**  Yes! We deserve just as much support and just as much acknowledgement in the industry as men do.

**Alessia:** Absolutely, we do. Day in and day out I show myself that I’m stronger, and that means so much to me because the only person I’m doing this for is myself.  

**Karii:** Exactly. We don’t have to fit into a box or conform to what society thinks we should be doing. We’re stronger, more powerful and creating spaces for ourselves, and it’s really great to see. 

**What’s the biggest challenge about being a woman in fitness in 2023?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Karii:** Feeling anxious or self-conscious about starting a fitness journey. 

**Sarah B:** Absolutely, it’s that feeling of not belonging. 

**Karii:** The gym can be an uncomfortable place but just focus on you and your body, not your surroundings.

**Sarah B:** Exactly. The weights area is often male dominated. You might feel like you don’t belong, intimidated and that people are staring at you or judging you because you might not have the correct technique. What I say is that the gym is for everybody. However you identify, you belong in that gym. 

**Karii:** Everyone’s journey is different, so just make your own small goals and you’ll soon get there.  

**Sarah B:** The gym should be a safe place for everyone to work on their gains and their mental and physical wellbeing. Go and get those gains because you do belong.

**Why should women strength train?**
------------------------------------

**Karii:** Not only does it do wonders for your physical mobility as well as your mental wellbeing, but you feel so empowered and strong. 

**Sarah B:** The health benefits associated with strength training are so important. It increases your quality of life, it makes you stronger and it enables you to do your daily activities with a lot more ease. 

**Sarah Jane:** Oh, there are so many reasons. For starters, it helps improve your posture, it helps increase your bone density and it helps to keep you healthy.

**Karii:** And you also get to sculpt your body in the way you want to, as well as burning the calories. 

**Sarah Jane:** And it helps with your motivation and confidence which is then going to transfer into your everyday life. Win win!

**What’s had you wished you’d known when starting your fitness journey?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sarah B:** That lifting heavy weights is fine. Gaining muscle is fine. Having a strong upper body and a strong core is fine. 

**Sarah Jane:** That a calorie deficit isn’t the only way to see results. 

**Alessia:** For me, I wish I’d known that listening to our bodies is essential. Rest is just as important as training. 

**Karii:** And just learning to be consistent. There are going to be times when you don’t feel motivated and that’s okay.

**Sarah B:** Don’t worry about what other people think. Having a nice physique is a sign of your hard work, your commitment and your dedication to the lifestyle you’ve chosen. 

**Karii:**  Absolutely, consistency breeds results. Make a weekly goal, hit your targets, keep going, keep pushing on and you will see the results. 

**What’s your favourite post-workout?**
---------------------------------------

**Sarah B:** Clear Whey! I don’t know if you guys consider it a snack. I do because it tastes like a fruit juice but has 20g of protein in it. I specifically like the Cherrybomb **[Clear Whey Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/clear-whey-isolate.html)** because it tastes great and increases my protein intake. 

**Sarah Jane:** I love the **[Protein Biscuits](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-biscuits/mmun-bisc)** from **Bulk**™ because they taste just like Oreos. 

**Alessia:** I love the Rocky Road **[Gourmet Vegan Bar](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/gourmet-vegan-bar/vser-vgba)**. Those veggie marshmallows are yummy!

**What’s the best workout gear?**
---------------------------------

**Sarah B:** Any form of sports bra, seamless leggings and seamless shorts sets. They make me feel confident in what I’m doing. They show off my gains in the right areas, if you know what I mean – snatched waist, tight glutes, nice quads. Yes! 

**Karii:** I think it’s the gear that you feel comfortable in. A t-shirt and jogging bottoms or whatever is comfortable but practical for the gym. Whatever you feel the most empowered in when you’re training is what you should wear.  

**Alessia:** I agree. I always go for the clothes I feel comfortable and confident in. 

**Sarah B:** It’s really nice when you go to the gym in one of these outfits and other people notice your gains and acknowledge them and ask for advice. You know you’re doing something right!

**Karii:** Also, you should never feel inclined to have to wear the latest trends. Just wear whatever you know you can fully be yourself in. 

**Do you have any daily non-negotiables?**
------------------------------------------

**Alessia:** Going out in nature – either a walk in the park or just to watch the sunset. 

**Sarah B:** Mine is to smile and laugh and enjoy life every single day. 

**Karii:** For me it’s eating breakfast. I strength train so I lift a lot of heavy weights. I need that extra energy in the morning to keep me going. It keeps me fuelled throughout the day.  

**Sarah B:** And also remember to have that sweet snack.

**Karii:** A little tip, if you don’t have much time in the morning, is to make some overnight oats that are ready to go or even a protein or meal shake. I love **Bulk**™ 1™ **[Complete Food Shake](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/1-complete-food-shake/bpfs-one)** – it keeps me going until lunchtime. 

**Summary**
-----------

Embracing equity in fitness spaces is the responsibility of everyone who uses them. True impartiality comes from everyone feeling supported and accepted in gyms and other sports facilities. This doesn’t mean offering advice or drawing attention to anyone, it simply means that if we are all more aware of those around us and respect that each person is on their own journey, we can create a truly safe space where the focus is purely on those personal goals.
