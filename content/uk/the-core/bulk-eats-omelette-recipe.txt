How often do you find an “easy”, “healthy” recipe online which turns out to not be so easy or healthy? Well, this one follows through on those promises. An omelette is a great option for a meal that’s packed with protein and is simple to prepare when you’re short on time. This recipe uses our Liquid Egg Whites to keep fat content at a minimum, and Active Seasoning to spice up the dish with your preferred flavour. Throw in some ham and diced peppers and you’ve got a well-rounded meal that can be prepared in minutes!
