Unflavoured amino acid supplements aren’t for faint hearted. Have you tried unflavoured BCAA Powder?

They certainly have their place in your supplement arsenal, especially when you’re mixing them into protein shakes and smoothies. But on their own, the taste of some can be described as a little unpleasant.

Instant BCAA, our best selling branched chain amino acid powder, is available in four delicious flavours as well as unflavoured – Cola, Apple & Lime, Mixed Berry and Tropical. You’d find it hard to believe it’s the same product as the unflavoured version as the taste is completely masked. [BCAAs](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids/bcaa) are the amino acids Leucine, Isoleucine and Valine and one of the [best supplements for muscle gain](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/5-best-supplements-muscle-gain/).

A couple of months ago we launched flavoured [Creatine Monohydrate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate/bpb-cmon-0000) and flavoured [Glutamine Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/glutamine-powder/bpb-lglu-0000) in Mixed Berry and Apple & Lime. Many customers like to add the unflavoured versions into their protein shake but here we give you the option to enjoy the benefits of both just by adding water.

You can now buy flavoured [Leucine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/leucine/bpb-lleu-0000) (Instant) in Mixed Berry and Apple & Lime flavours. We’ve started with these flavours because they’ve been so well received for Instant BCAA, Creatine Monohydrate and Glutamine.

Why supplement with Leucine?
----------------------------

Instant Leucine is an improved form of Leucine. It has gone through a patented micro-encapsulation process which allows for a rapid dispersion and solubility in water. This means, unlike many other sources of Leucine, it has an almost neutral taste without any foaming or insolubility when mixed.

Research has shown that Leucine plays a vital role in the stimulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. Leucine also contributes to the growth and maintenance in muscle mass for anyone taking part in physical exercise.

At **Bulk™**, you can buy Leucine supplements in three forms – Leucine Tablets, Leucine Powder and Instant Leucine Powder. We also have many products with Leucine in the ingredients list (see below).

### COMPLETE SERIES™

Many of our COMPLETE SERIES™ formulas include Leucine. Here are five examples we’ve picked out.

#### Complete Bedtime™

3g added pharmaceutical grade L-Leucine alongside Micellar Casein, HMB, Tryptophan, Theanine and Lysine. A slow release protein shake before bed with carefully selected ingredients at optimal dosages to aid sleep and muscular recovery. Most ‘bedtime protein’ formulas are slow release protein blends without these additional ingredients (or just a couple of them).

#### Complete Pre-Workout™ Caffeine Free

3:1:1 BCAA with 3g Leucine (instantised). A very well dosed caffeine free pre-workout formula. See how it compares to [My Protein™ Impact Pump Blend](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/complete-pre-workout-caffeine-free-vs-impact-pump-blend/).

#### Complete Recovery™

3g Leucine (instantised) per serving alongside Waxy Maize Starch, Whey Protein Isolate, L-Glutamine, Tart Cherry Extract, HMB, Acetyl L-Carnitine, Vitamin C and Vitamin B6. An excellent recovery formula, especially for those of you training for endurance outside of the gym.

#### Complete BCAA Energy™

An extremely well dosed amino energy drink with BCAA in a 3:1:1 ratio (3g instantised Leucine) alongside L-Glutamine, Green Coffee Extract and Guarana. The formula is better dosed than [Optimum Nutrition Amino Energy](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/complete-bcaa-energy-vs-optimum-nutrition-amino-energy/).
