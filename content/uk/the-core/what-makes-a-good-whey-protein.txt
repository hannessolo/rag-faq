Whey Protein is an extremely popular sports supplement. The benefits attributed to protein are well known, whether youâ€™re on a mission to build muscle or simply increase your intake of quality protein as part of a healthier diet. But with so many brands, and a plethora of different products, it can be a struggle to decide which product is right for you.

Thatâ€™s the great thing about whey protein. Itâ€™s such a versatile product â€“ it can be used by almost anyone to support a specific fitness or lifestyle goal. For this very reason, itâ€™s a great starting point if you are new to supplements.

### So what makes a good whey protein?

First and foremost, itâ€™s all about quality. A whey protein is only as good as its source, and the process it undertakes from supplier to your door. Luckily for you, weâ€™ve got this down to a fine art.

### **Quality.**

Our Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ is a premium quality whey protein, purchased directly from Europeâ€™s most reputable dairy. But this isnâ€™t just any dairy. The cowâ€™s here enjoy some of the tastiest grass around, meaning that the milk they produce contains less contaminants and impurities, delivering a massive 82% whey protein.

[BULK POWDERSâ„¢ Pure Whey Protein](../../pure-whey-protein.html)â„¢ is manufactured from sweet cheese whey using advanced cross-flow membrane filtration. It is then agglomerated and instantised, using a small amount of soy lecithin to ensure instant mixability.

We keep things as pure as we can. We donâ€™t add anything to our protein unless it is completely necessary. Our Unflavoured Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ contains just the whey protein derived from the milk. The only ingredient added is a small amount of Soya Lecithin (0.4%) which acts as an instantising agent to improve the mixability of the product when mixed with water or milk. What you wonâ€™t get are any unncessary fillers, ever. The integrity of our Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢, and all the supplements we provide, is incredibly important. External testing is frequently undertaken and a [certificate of analysis](../../assets/coa/PureWheyProtein17062015.pdf) is provided for each product to clearly show the ingredients used.

### **Taste.**

A lot can be said about the taste of a whey protein. Some people prefer whey protein in its purest form, unflavoured. The advantage of choosing unflavoured Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ is that you are guaranteed 82% protein per serving, whereas with flavoured Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ this percentage does reduce by approximately 3-5% depending on the flavour selected. But unflavoured protein isnâ€™t for everyone.

As such, we take the process of creating new protein flavours very seriously and we do it all in-house, unlike many of our competitors. This is often a painstaking process, making sure the combination of flavours is absolutely spot on before releasing something new. This can mean several months between new releases, but taste and quality are paramount; getting this right is the key and this really sets us apart.

### **Price.**

We all want a great deal but often price is indicative of quality, isnâ€™t it? As one of Europeâ€™s fastest growing and longest established sports nutrition brands, we have built a strong relationship with our whey protein supplier. Due to the volume of orders we guarantee each month, we are in a position to negotiate better costs, which in turn allows us to offer the cheapest prices on whey protein in Europe. **We deliver the absolute best quality protein at the lowest price â€“ guaranteed!**

### **Mixability.**

Itâ€™s a pet hate for some. You mix up a shake and when it comes to drinking it, itâ€™s full of lumps. **You wonâ€™t get lumpy protein from us!** Our Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ is agglomerated and instantised at source, using a small amount of soy lecithin to ensure instant mixability and prevent excess foaming when the product is shaken. Imagine how amazing your bed feels on a Sunday morning. Now think of something equally satisfying. Combine the two and you get an idea for how good our protein really is.

We are well known for having a Pure Whey Proteinâ„¢ that is top quality, great tasting, easy to mix and at the best prices on the market â€“ bar none. If youâ€™re serious about your protein game, choose BULK POWDERSâ„¢.

### But donâ€™t just take our word for it. See what some of our happy customers have to say:

> **Great Taste â€” Katy on 24/07/2015  
> **  
> Really impressed with this product. Bought Vanilla to try it as the price is a lot less than most. Really enjoyed it, mixes really well with water. Iâ€™ve tried a couple of products before looking at Bulk Powders and they all clumped or tasted vile. This is delicious! Will be buying more when this pouch runs out.

> Amazing Product â€” Ash on 10/07/2015

> Amazing product does what it says on the tin, well in this case the bag. Unflavoured variant tastes good and is good value for money, tastes better then competitor products (Myprotein). To conclude this is a good product that should be bought instantly.

> **Best Chocolate Peanut Taste Ever â€” Scott on 03/06/2015**
> 
> Iâ€™ve tried all sorts of protein in the past, my favourite being chocolate peanut, bulkpowders version is by far the best Iâ€™ve ever had, it tastes like real peanuts have been used, so much so I actually checked the ingredients lol â€“ also tried the banana which is really nice. So I guess Iâ€™ll be getting all my protein from BP now ðŸ™‚
