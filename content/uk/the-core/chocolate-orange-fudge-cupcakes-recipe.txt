When she’s not fighting off mythical creatures with the spatula of gains, our trusty baker Hebe is busy in the kitchen creating things like this Chocolate Orange Fudge Cupcakes recipe. With over 10g protein per cupcake, these little treats are packed full of muscle building goodness!

### Instructions

1.) Preheat the oven to 175C.

2.) Combine all the ingredients together in a bowl and blend until smooth. Taste the batter to see if it’s sweet enough for you, adjust accordingly. Divide between 5 large silicone cake cases and pop in the oven to bake for 20-25 minutes. Allow to cool.

3.) Meanwhile, making the frosting. In a small bowl, melt the coconut oil. Stir in the HydroBEEF™ and PPB (or peanut flour). Add a blob of the greek yoghurt and stir into a smooth paste. Gradually add the remaining frosting. Pop in the fridge to firm up a little, if you can be bothered! Then pipe or spread onto the cooled cakes.
