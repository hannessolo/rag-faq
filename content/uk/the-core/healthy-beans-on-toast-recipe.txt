Some say whilst everyone in Gibraltar is getting drunk to celebrate Gibraltar Day, Elke from The Muscle Bakery will be sipping on her Cola Instant BCAA whilst thinking about the next recipe she can make for her needy BULK POWDERS™ fanboys. Others say she might even miss the event to prepare for the best after party the Mountain of Tariq has ever witnessed – [peanut butter](../../peanut-butter.html) food fights, wrestling in [protein dessert](../../complete-protein-dessert.html), beer pong using [Chocolate Whey Balls](../../chocolate-whey-balls.html)™, spin the [water bottle](https://www.bulk.com/uk/pro-seriestm-black-water-bottle-750ml.html) and drinking games with [Complete BCAA Energy](../../complete-bcaa-energy.html)™ shots.

That’s not to say Elke is not the life and soul of the party, she’s a bundle of fun! We also love her because she comes up with recipes that we never thought were possible. Using our Chia Seeds, Liquid Egg Whites and Coconut Flour, ditch the Warburtons loaf and make your own flatbread for the quick yet nutritious meal – Beans on Toast!

Each slice of home made flatbread delivers over 12g protein and just 135 calories. Being on a tight budget doesn’t have to mean eating unhealthy foods, especially when you can make meals yourself. Get in the kitchen and have a go.

### Instructions:

1.) Pre-heat oven to 180 Degrees C and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper or a silicone mat.

2.) Mix all your ingredients in a bowl, in no particular order.

3.) Transfer mix onto prepared tray or mat and with a spoon spread your mix evenly and up to the edges.

4.) Bake for 10 – 15 minutes until edges start to crisp/golden.

5.) Remove from oven and leave to cool for approximately 10 minutes before slicing.

Once ready, eat on its own, toasted or topped with some baked beans!
