Not every day can be beast mode. Here’s how to get yourself in the mood for training.

Real life isn’t like a string of memes on your Instagram feed. “Team No Sleep” does sometimes need a nap in the afternoon, and “the grind” can get pretty tired. So what should you do when Beast Mode seems to have passed you by?

The truth is, there’s nothing wrong with taking an extra rest day or two when you need it. If you’re in this for the long term, then a couple of days off are a drop in the ocean.

But consistency is the name of the game, and so you will need to train when you feel tired, stressed, or down in the dumps. If you wait for the stars to align, you’ll only end up with a handful of sessions in your log book at the end of the year.

Here are 9 ways to boost your mood in and out of the gym:

Music
-----

Everyone knows that music has the power to boost mood and get us fired up. Use music to get yourself in the mood for training. Play it loud at home whilst you get your gym bag ready. Play your favourite high energy tunes in the car. Make a playlist for training (or ask the gym to play your tunes, if you’re lucky!)

New Kit
-------

If you’re feeling a bit bored about training, invest in one piece of new kit. It could be something practical like [lifting straps](https://www.bulk.com/uk/lifting-straps.html), [a belt](https://www.bulk.com/uk/training-belt.html), or [wrist wraps](https://www.bulk.com/uk/wrist-wraps.html). Or just something to make you look and feel good, like a new [training top](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-performance-t-shirt.html).

Coffee
------

You can always rely on caffeine for a pick-me-up! If you’re feeling tired or demotivated, go for a short black coffee or espresso before training. If you don’t like coffee but want the benefits of caffeine, sip on [Complete BCAA Energy™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-bcaa-energy.html) which is a refreshing blend of 3:1:1 BCAAs plus caffeine. Or try [Caffeine Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/caffeine.html) or [Caffeine Tablets](https://www.bulk.com/uk/caffeine-tablets.html) (ideal for keeping in your [gym bag](https://www.bulk.com/uk/gym-bag.html)).

Make It Social
--------------

It can be tough to get motivated for a solo training session. If you’re usually a lone wolf, why not arrange to train with a friend just this once? The social aspect will give your mood a boost, you’ll have a laugh, and probably learn a few new exercises too. Choose someone who’s ambitious, focused, and ideally slightly stronger than you.

Reward Yourself
---------------

Training should be rewarding enough, but sometimes you need an extra pat on the back. Promise yourself that if you go training today, you can place a new supplement order or treat yourself to something you wouldn’t normally buy – like [protein cookies](https://www.bulk.com/uk/high-protein-cookies.html)!

Do Your Favourite Things
------------------------

If you really don’t want to do your scheduled session, give yourself a break. Go to the gym, and just do all your favourite exercises. Throw in some things you haven’t done in ages, or try something you saw on YouTube and have been meaning to do. Make it fun!

Tryptophan
----------

Keep some natural mood and cognition supplements on hand for days like these. [Tryptophan](https://www.bulk.com/uk/tryptophan.html) is an essential amino acid that is a precursor of melatonin and the “happy hormone” seratonin.

[DL Phenylalanine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/dl-phenylalanine.html) is a form of another amino acid (Phenylalanine) that converts into the amino acid L-Tyrosine in the body. L-Tyrosine is a brain messenger that can be converted into neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters boost your mood and promote positive, energised feelings.

[Complete Stimulant™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/complete-stimulant.html) is our all-rounder which contains all natural nutrients to stimulate your body and mind, including [Caffeine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/caffeine.html), [DMAE](https://www.bulk.com/uk/dmae-powder.html), [Taurine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/taurine.html) and [Tyrosine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/tyrosine.html). It’s ideal for those days when you’d rather head straight home to the sofa instead of going to the gym.
