Intra-workout supplementation has often been overlooked in favour of both pre and post workout, but intra-workout supplements play an important role too. You probably already have your pre-workout supplements covered, but once your workout has started, you need something to give you a steady carb release to ensure that your body keeps on releasing insulin. Insulin is key to keeping your body in an anabolic state for the duration of your workout, and as your training session goes on, you need to release it in greater amounts.

A proven way to get insulin levels rising is to provide your body with the right fuel – nutrients and carbs. But in lieu of actually taking a break and eating something, what is it that you need in your shaker for a mid-workout pick-me-up?

We take a look below at five intra-workout supplements that you could consider using during your gym sessions.

Complete Intra-Workout™
-----------------------

[Complete Intra-Workout™](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/complete-intra-workout/bble-ciwo "Complete Intra-Workout™") is ideal for intense training sessions as it provides the body with a constant supply of amino acids. Containing branched chain amino acids including leucine, plus glutamine and citrulline malate, Complete Intra-Workout™ has been designed to maintain performance during training.

Waxy Maize Starch
-----------------

Waxy Maize Starch is one of the more recent sports carbohydrates to hit the performance nutrition market. A fast absorbing carbohydrate, it restores muscle glycogen (muscle energy) 70% faster than dextrose, meaning that it’s suitable for both intra and post workout. As it only sits in the stomach for a short period of time, there is no danger of it leaving you feeling bloated or uncomfortable during your workout.

Vitargo®
--------

[Vitargo®](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/vitargo/bpb-vigo-0000 "Vitargo") is another fast absorbing carbohydrate which provides almost instant energy to working muscles. It gives an increase in energy but without the ‘crash’ of a sugar based product – making it ideal if your gym session is going to last 45 minutes or more. Alongside an increase in energy, Vitargo® also keeps blood sugar levels elevated and leaves no bloated feeling after consumption.

Branched Chain Amino Acids
--------------------------

[Branched Chain Amino Acids](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/amino-acids/bcaa "BCAA Supplements") have many benefits, but one of the most beneficial for those taking BCAAs intra-workout is their ability to promote anabolism within the body. BULK POWDERS™ Branched Chain Amino Acids comprise of leucine, isoleucine and valine in a 2:1:1 ratio. Leucine has been shown to act as an anabolic signaler and may “turn on” muscle growth.

Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate
-------------------------------

[Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/hydrolysed-whey-protein-isolate/bpb-hwpi-0000 "Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate") is the fastest absorbing Whey Protein Isolate available. Not all proteins are suitable for use intra-workout – you need your protein to be easily digestible, fast absorbing and able to spike amino acid levels quickly, which is why Hydrolysed Whey Protein Isolate is ideal. Hydrolysed protein has already been broken down so your body can absorb it quickly and get it to your muscles when they need it most.
