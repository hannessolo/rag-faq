The supplement everyone has heard of, [creatine](https://www.bulk.com/uk/sports-nutrition/creatine.html) is widely embraced by bodybuilders, because of its affordability, versatility and effectiveness.

Oh, and creatine is also the ‘most researched supplement’, but since that’s mentioned every single time creatine is talked about, we won’t go into that too much. 

All you need to know, for now, is that creatine is credible, creatine is effective and creatine ‘works’. (Not that other supplements don’t ‘work’, it’s just that creatine is so well-proven that its effectiveness is indisputable). 

In this article, we go into exactly _how_ it works, focusing on the five key creatine benefits. Brace yourself for some science.

**What is creatine?**
---------------------

“Creatine is an organic compound present in everyone’s muscles, serving as a rapid source of high-intensity energy”, explains in-house expert, [Simon Jurkiv](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/authors/simon-jurkiw/).

“There’s so many misconceptions about what creatine actually is”, says Simon. “Creatine is found in everyone’s muscles, and put simply, it’s an organic compound used for high-intensity energy.”

The average 70kg person stores around 100-120g in their skeletal muscle but can store 160g. Creatine supplementation aims to fill up this tank.

As well as being produced naturally in the liver, we get creatine from protein-rich foods like meat and fish. But to reap the performance-enhancing benefits, supplementation is beneficial to maximise creatine stores in the muscles.

In a normal diet that contains 1-2 g creatine per day, muscle creatine stores are about 60-80% saturated. Supplementation aims to get that to 100%.

**What do experts say about creatine benefits?**
------------------------------------------------

Simon Jurkiw is a renowned performance nutritionist with nearly two decades worth of experience. While holding an undergrad and postgraduate degrees in sports nutrition, he has competed as a bodybuilder and powerlifter. He has both expertise on both an academic and practical level. Here’s his take on creatine benefits.

“The number one reason you would use creatine is to improve performance, be it gym performance or sporting performance.

“Creatine is naturally prevalent in the diet. However, you just can’t get an adequate amount to increase performance. For example, you would need over 1kg of beef to see any performance-enhancing effect. And that is a lot of beef. 

“With [Creatine Monohydrate Powder](https://www.bulk.com/uk/products/creatine-monohydrate/bpb-cmon-0000), you get 5g in one tiny scoop. Job done.

“So, if you’re looking to increase gym performance, or high-intensity sporting performance, creatine is the one.”

**Improved performance in high-intensity exercise**
---------------------------------------------------

Creatine enhances performance in activities requiring short bursts of energy, like throwing, sprinting, or weightlifting.

This boost is achieved with a daily intake of 3g (or more, depending on your weight), facilitating increased energy production through the replenishment of ATP. ATP is short for Adenosine Triphosphate. 

To understand how creatine works, it’s worth going over the body’s energy production mechanisms, and the types of exercise they are used for. These are:

*   Anaerobic systems – prolonged fast runs, like a 100-400 metre sprint.
*   Aerobic (or oxidative) – steadier runs, like a 10k.
*   ATP-CP pathway – explosive movement, such as jumping, throwing, or lifting weights. Short sprints are also included (think about sports like football where you may be sprinting, then stopping a lot).

[Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)](https://www.britannica.com/science/adenosine-triphosphate) serves as the cell’s energy carrier, crucial for rapid movements. When cells use ATP for energy, it transforms into adenosine diphosphate (ADP), releasing energy. 

In the form of creatine phosphate, creatine sits in muscles and plays a vital role. Creatine donates a phosphate group to ADP, converting it back into ATP (Di to Tri).

This cycle, sustained by creatine, enables ATP to lose and regain a phosphate group, generating continuous energy. Increased creatine stores through supplementation enhance cellular phosphocreatine, making that process of turning ADP into ATP more efficient, and happen for longer.

In simple terms, creatine maximises high-intensity energy output. 

**Support for muscular size and strength**
------------------------------------------

Directly linked to enhanced performance, creatine’s ability to improve physical output lays the groundwork for muscle growth. 

As explained just above, creatine plays a vital role in energy production for rapid, explosive movements. This includes lifting weights.

This means that on creatine, you should be able to do more repetitions than you previously could at a certain weight. 

“In the gym, creatine will help you to do more reps and it’ll help you to lift more weight. Ultimately, creating a greater stimulus for muscle growth”, says Jurkiw. 

**Improved muscular endurance**
-------------------------------

This benefit is less secure than the one above, but it’s worth hearing about. Especially if you’re an endurance athlete.

While not necessarily impacting overall race times, creatine supplementation shows promise in enhancing recovery. Studies suggest reduced protein and muscle glycogen degradation after running, potentially leading to faster recovery between endurance exercises.

In one study, healthy young male athletes took a high amount of creatine (12g/day) for 15 days. They showed signs of [less protein and muscle glycogen breakdown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3407788/) after 60 minutes of running. This suggests that recovery might be faster and less painful, which is beneficial for repeated endurance exercises.

**Enhanced cognitive performance**
----------------------------------

Creatine’s positive impact extends to cognitive functions such as focus, reaction time, and problem-solving. Studies explore its potential to counteract age-related decline, particularly in older individuals with lower creatine levels. 

However, research on its effectiveness in crossing the blood-brain barrier is ongoing.

**Increased bone health**
-------------------------

As creatine research evolves, its multifaceted benefits continue to unfold. This is another one that’s entered the fray, again, less certified than the first two.

Some research suggests that combining creatine supplementation with resistance training can lead to increased bone mineral content and a reduction in bone resorption, offering valuable insights for healthy ageing.

With a growing emphasis on ageing-related research, further exploration of creatine’s potential is an avenue for future research. Who knows what might be discovered next?

**FAQs: Creatine Benefits**
---------------------------

### **What is the main purpose of taking creatine?**

The primary purpose of taking creatine is to enhance athletic performance and support muscle strength and growth.

Creatine is a natural compound found in muscles, and supplementing with it helps increase the body’s creatine phosphate stores. This leads to improved energy production during high-intensity activities.

### **Should you take creatine every day?**

Yes, taking creatine daily is recommended for optimal results. Consistent daily supplementation of 3g maintains elevated creatine levels in the muscles, ensuring a constant supply for ATP resynthesis. 

This is especially crucial for individuals engaged in regular high-intensity exercise. Gym-goers, for instance.

### **Does creatine have side effects?**

Creatine is generally safe and well-tolerated when used as directed. However, some individuals may experience minor side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort or muscle cramping.

Staying hydrated and adhering to recommended dosages can minimise any potential [creatine side effects](https://www.bulk.com/uk/the-core/creatine-side-effects/).

### **Are there negatives to creatine?**

Not really. Considering the remarkable benefits of creatine supplementation and its minimal side effects, the positives far outweigh any potential drawbacks. It is widely regarded as a safe and effective supplement for improving athletic performance and muscle development.

### **Does creatine cause hair loss?**

There isn’t much to indicate that creatine supplementation actually causes hair loss. In fact, much of the evidence for the link is anecdotal. 

However, there is a study that often gets brought up in this discussion.

In 2009, a study involving college-age rugby players found [increased levels of DHT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19741313/) following three weeks of creatine supplementation. Why is this significant? 

Well, DHT levels play a role in hair loss, and this increase could put you at risk, particularly if you’re genetically predisposed to hair loss. Essentially, this outlines an indirect relationship between creatine and hair loss. But still, as the study itself states, more research is needed into creatine’s effect on DHT levels.

### **Will creatine burn fat?**

No, not directly. 

While creatine itself does not burn fat, the enhanced performance during high-intensity workouts can lead to more effective calorie burning and improved body composition.

### **Benefits of taking creatine without working out**

Taking creatine without working out may still offer some benefits, such as improved cognitive function and potential support for certain health conditions.

However, the full spectrum of creatine advantages is best realised when combined with regular exercise, particularly high-intensity activities that tap into its energy-boosting properties.

**Summary: Creatine benefits**
------------------------------

It is clear that creatine is an effective supplement and can provide benefits well beyond those of growth and strength gains. Chances are, your training could benefit on some level from this supplement. So you might as well try it.
