### Summary

This is a quick and easy recipe for all chocolate lovers to enjoy. With subtle hints of ginger, it’s a great high-protein dessert treat, oozing with chocolatey greatness. Give this Ginger Chocolate Protein Mugcake a try yourself – you won’t regret it!

### Instructions

1.) First mix all the wet ingredients in a large, microwave-safe mug.

2.) In a separate bowl mix together all the dry ingredients.

3.) Then gradually mix the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients in the mug.

4.) Once the mixture is lump-free, place the mug in the microwave and cook for about 2 minutes, but keep a close eye on it as it does have a tendency to rapidly expand and spill! If this starts to happen, open the door, allow to cool for a few seconds, then continue cooking.

**Topping instructions:** Mix all ingredients together (except the quinoa pops) and pour over the mugcake. Then sprinkle the quinoa pops on top.
