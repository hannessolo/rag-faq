Vitamin B Supplements
=====================

category

vitamins/vitamin-b

Vitamin B comprises over half of the vitamins that our bodies require to function – so a Vitamin B deficiency can be quite debilitating and often manifests through physical symptoms such as tiredness and fatigue. Vitamin B contributes to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue, which makes it a perfect go-to supplement for anyone looking to improve their energy levels.

Vegetarians and vegans in particular, can struggle to consume adequate Vitamin B through their diet, so supplementation is often recommended – particularly as Vitamin B is involved in a range of bodily processes – ranging from the formation of red blood cells to the function of the nervous system.

**Bulk™** stocks a wide range of the highest quality and potency Vitamin B supplements – from our fully-comprehensive **[B Vitamin Complex](/uk/products/b-vitamin-complex-tablets/bpb-bvit-0000)** formula, which contains all eight B Vitamins, plus Choline, PABA and Inositol – to individual B Vitamins such as **[Vitamin B5 Powder](/uk/products/vitamin-b5/bpb-b5p-0000)** or **[Vitamin B12 Tablets](/uk/products/vitamin-b12-tablets-1000-mcg/bpb-vb12-0000)**.

Vitamin B FAQ'S
---------------

Do vitamin B supplements do anything?

B vitamins play a key role in maintaining positive health and wellbeing. Being the building blocks of a healthy body, B complex vitamins contribute to the normal energy yielding metabolism, cognitive function, as well as nervous system function.

Is it ok to take B Complex everyday?

Yes. We advise taking 1 tablet per day of our B Vitamin Complex Tablets, ideally with food.

Should I take B12 or B complex?

The main difference between B12 and B complex is that B12 is just one of the eight B vitamins that make up the B complex. Whichever one you choose to take would largely depend on your intended use, but both are good options for topping up either your B12 levels and/or your B-vitamins as a whole.

What is the best vitamin B supplement?

Our High Strength Vitamin B12 tablets are ideal for anyone looking to boost their B12 intake, providing 40,000% of your reference intake. Though, if you’re looking to cover all bases when it comes to B Vitamins, our B Vitamin Complex Tablets are our top pick.
