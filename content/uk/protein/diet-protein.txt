Protein keeps you fuller for longer, so is ideal for those trying to cut down on snacking. It also contributes to growth in muscle mass, which helps you stay fit as you lose weight. Our diet protein range differs from our normal protein range as it's lower in calories and carbohydrates. Some of the products in this section also contain additional fat loss ingredients such as CLA and L-Carnitine.
