Whey Protein FAQ'S
------------------

What is whey protein?

Whey is a by-product of the cheese-making process. It’s considered to be a complete protein as it contains all 9 essential amino acids fundamental for muscle growth and development. That’s also why it’s one of the most popular supplements around.

Is whey protein powder good for you?

There are plenty of myths surrounding supplements and whey protein isn’t excluded from some of them. However, it is a source of amino acids that our body can digest quickly. Of course, make sure your whey powder of choice is transparently formulated and offers strong nutritional values.

What are the benefits of whey protein?

Whey protein blends are a convenient and effective way of meeting your daily protein requirements, especially if you’re in a rush! This is because whey protein is easy to mix and relatively fast-absorbing. It also offers fundamental support for post-workout recovery and muscle repair. As a result, whey supplements can be extremely beneficial for sports performance.

Which Bulk™ whey protein product will work best for you?

To find out, you’ll have to think about your goals. Are you looking for a complete and exceptionally premium formula? INFORMED WHEY® is what you’re after. If you’re looking for a protein supplement for weight loss, CUTTING EDGE™ PROTEIN can support you with that.

Are whey protein shakes healthy?

When taken as part of a healthy and balanced diet, a protein supplement is a straightforward, fuss-free way of upping your dietary protein intake. It’s a safe and quick way to help you maintain muscle. Of course, every formula is different and that’s what you need to look out for.

Can whey protein make you gain weight?

The type of weight you can gain with whey protein supplements is usually very specific. Provided you workout regularly, supplementing your diet with protein shakes, will allow you to increase your lean muscle mass that will also result in weight gain.

Can whey protein help with weight loss?

Alongside a healthy, balanced and calorie-restricted diet, whey powders such as CUTTING EDGE™ PROTEIN and Complete Diet Protein™ ADVANCED can support you with your weight loss goals.
