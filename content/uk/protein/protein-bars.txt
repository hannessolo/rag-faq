**Protein bars**. A convenient way of increasing your daily protein intake.  
High protein bars use only the best sources of protein, such as milk and whey protein. Unlike other brands, our protein bars do not contain gelatine. This means every single bar we make is suitable for vegetarians.

Along with these high-protein bars, you'll also find a range of delicious **[high-protein snacks](/uk/protein/protein-snacks)**. Whether it's the sweet-craving satisfiers like **[Protein Flapjacks](/uk/products/high-protein-flapjack/bpf-hpfl)** and **[Protein Biscuits](/uk/products/macro-munch-protein-biscuits/mmun-bisc)**, or the savoury delights of **[Beef Jerky](/uk/products/beef-jerky/bpf-bjer)**, we have you covered for all protein snacking needs.

Instead of a snack on the go or a classic protein shake, check out our [Whey Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/whey-protein). If you prefer an alternative to dairy, try our [Beef Protein](https://www.bulk.com/uk/protein/beef-protein). Or, if you're after a plant-based option, our [Vegan Protein Bars](https://www.bulk.com/uk/vegan/vegan-protein-bars) are a great choice.

Protein FAQs
------------

What are protein bars?

Protein bars are nutritional snack bars. They’re like regular snack bars, but high in protein. They come in a variety of flavours and nutritional profiles and they’re an easy way to increase your daily protein intake or use as pre-workout fuel or post-workout recovery.

Is it OK to have a protein bar every day?

A meal replacement bar is similar to a protein bar but usually higher in calories, fat, and fibre, marketed to replace meals. They are different to protein bars.
