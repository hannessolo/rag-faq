Collagen is a protein that is found throughout your body. It is the most abundant protein in skin, bone, connective tissue and muscle, and it accounts for one third of your entire protein composition. Supplements are an easy way to increase your intake of this essential protein, which has grown in popularity for its nutritional properties, particularly around skincare. What are the benefits of collagen supplements? If you do any kind of strength training, you should be consuming higher levels of protein to support muscle mass maintenance. Collagen is part of your protein intake, and contributes to bone health, skin and cartilage function. In supplement form, they’re highly-concentrated, available in a range of different flavours, and convenient to implement into your diet. Which products are high in collagen? Here at Bulk™, we offer a range of collagen products. Whether you love a powdered drink, enjoy the ease of a capsule, or even want to merge your morning coffee with the nutritional benefits of a high-protein hit, we’ve got you covered. What is the best time to take it? Collagen supplements are designed to be taken at any time of day. Because of their high-protein content, they’re especially good as a pre-workout, or even post-workout supplement. What are the different types of collagen supplements? Collagen comes in a range of forms, primarily in powder and capsule. Our powders come in a range of flavours, to be mixed with water and sipped throughout the day, or you may prefer a capsule to be taken once per day, with food, for an easy protein boost. At bulk®, we’ve also launched our COLLAGEN BLACK COFFEE, merging your morning caffeine hit with 18g of protein to get your day started. Who should take collagen tablets? Our UC-II® & VITAMIN C CAPSULES are Non-GM, Gluten Free, no added dairy, and Lactose Free.. They’re not suitable for Vegetarians or Vegans. You should always check the label if you have any special dietary requirements. Are collagen pills or powders better? It’s entirely up to you whether you prefer capsules or powders; only you know what will suit your training and lifestyle regimen. You can be assured of high protein content in both; our powders offer around 12g with each serving (we recommend up to 3 servings per day), whilst our capsules contain 40mg of standardised chicken cartilage, which contains type 2 collagen. Is collagen protein the same as protein? The short answer is no. Amino acids, the building blocks of protein, are what make certain proteins different from one another. Collagen protein powder has a very different set of amino acids in comparison to the protein typically found in animal and plant-based protein powders. What is the difference between collagen and collagen peptides? The main difference between collagen and collagen peptides is that collagen peptides are generally more bioavailable. Collagen peptides are hydrolysed, thus resulting in a more readily available form of collagen which is better absorbed into the bloodstream. Put simply, collagen peptides are the more broken down form of collagen. What is collagen hydrolysate? Collagen hydrolysate, or hydrolysed collagen, is just another name for collagen peptides, the more broken down form of collagen.
