| Protein Blends are simply a combination of protein sources, and are also referred to as multi-source proteins. As opposed to using a single protein source to meet your protein requirements, Protein Blends contain a range of proteins, all of which have varying    |
| amino acid profiles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Recent research suggests that Protein Blends are in fact superior to using Whey Protein as a standalone protein source. This is not to say, however, that there is not a place for both. Rapidly digesting protein sources such as Whey Protein are perfect for        |
| consumption before after exercise – and are viewed as superior to a Protein Blend to this extent. That said, multi-source Protein Blends are the optimal choice for at other times of day; such as between meals or before bed, where they provide a slower, more      |
| steady supply of protein to the muscles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
