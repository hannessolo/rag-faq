Weight loss FAQS
----------------

What is a weight loss supplement?

When used in conjunction with a healthy and balanced diet and lifestyle, supplements for weight loss can support your efforts in reaching this specific goal. They usually consist of shakes, tablets, teas and weight loss pills designed to support your body in its energy-burning efforts. If you follow the keto diet, MCT oil is the ideal choice. Plus, they can make you feel fuller and help you stay within the limits of your calorie-restricted diet.

How do weight loss supplements work?

Weight loss pills and weight loss supplements can give you an extra energy boost for your workouts, helping you to stay focused on the task at hand and support your body in its fat loss efforts. Certain weight loss supplements may also help manage food cravings, helping you to consume fewer calories, while some may generally help the fat burning process alongside a healthy diet and lifestyle.

How can you lose weight?

The only two guaranteed ways in which you can reduce your body weight are constant exercise and a calorie-restricted diet. That will allow you to burn more calories than you consume and reach the deficit you’ll need to lose weight in a steady and healthy way. Of course, supplements for weight loss are only there to help you manage this process that takes time, patience and commitment. No supplement will be able to deliver results alone and they’re not intended as meal replacements or shortcuts.

What is a healthy weight?

This entirely depends on your age, gender, body shape, muscle-fat ratio and height. Even though each case is unique, there are general guidelines you can refer to and identify a bracket that works for you. A popular way of understanding if your body weight is in a healthy place is by calculating your body mass index. There are plenty of online tools that can help you calculate that when you input your height and weight.

What different weight loss supplements are available at Bulk™?

We offer a wide range of weight loss supplements to suit all dietary requirements including single ingredients such as glucomannan as well as premium products such as CUTTING EDGE™ capsules and CUTTING EDGE™ Protein.

What are the best weight loss supplements?

There's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to weight loss supplements. At Bulk™ we offer a range of diet shakes, low calorie foods and more to help you achieve your weight loss goals. Some of our best-sellers include our Zero Calorie Syrup range, Green Tea Extract, and our Complete Thermogenic.

How do you keep muscle but lose fat?

To lose fat you should be in a calorie deficit. It’s important to eat enough protein and continue doing resistance training even while in a calorie deficit if you want to maintain muscle mass. Make sure your calorie deficit isn’t too extreme so that your weight loss is controlled and sustainable, without losing too much muscle. Listen to your body and adjust as much as you need.
