Carnitine is typically used for fat loss due to its important role in fat metabolism. It helps to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria, which are then burnt as energy.

In addition, carnitine also has cognitive benefits, as well as reducing muscle damage after exercise. Whatever you're reason for using carnitine, and whether it's Carnitine Capsules or Carnitine Powder, **Bulk™** has a wide range of quality carnitine supplements at fantastic prices, including our popular [L-Carnitine L-Tartrate Capsules](/uk/products/l-carnitine-l-tartrate-capsules-1000mg/bpb-lclt-0000).

L-Carnitine FAQS
----------------

What are l-carnitine supplements?

L-Carnitine supplements are any kind of nutritional supplement, powder, pill or tablet designed to provide additional L-Carnitine nutrition. They’re commonly sold in pill or capsule form, but can also be found in a variety of multi-nutrient formulas, particularly training and fitness supplements – our most popular supplement is a simple L-Carnitine capsule.

What are the benefits of taking carnitine tablets?

L-Carnitine is a branched nonessential amino acid, meaning it performs similar functions in your body to other amino acids. L-Carnitine supplements are generally intended for anybody who wants to supplement their regular dietary and nutritional intake with additional L-Carnitine. Because they’re usually sold as pills or mixable powders, they’re an easy way to get additional L-Carnitine without altering your regular diet.

Are they healthy?

L-Carnitine is a nonessential amino acid, meaning your body produces it naturally as part of everyday bodily functions. Some people choose to supplement their body with extra L-Carnitine to ensure their body has a strong supply of L-Carnitine throughout the day. For these reasons, L-Carnitine is perfectly healthy as part of a balanced, varied diet, taken as instructed.

When should you take carnitine supplements?

Like most other amino acids, most people choose to take L-Carnitine as part of a pre-workout shake formula to provide their body with the nutrition they need for an intense workout session. Because your body produces L-Carnitine naturally throughout the day, there’s no reason you can’t take L-Carnitine supplements any time of day also – most people choose to take them with meals, or before workouts.

Who should take l-carnitine powders?

L-Carnitine powders and supplements are intended for anyone who wants to supplement their regular diet with additional L-Carnitine. Because it’s produced naturally by your body, it’s a perfectly healthy supplement to take as part of a healthy diet with regular exercise – but if you’re not sure if it’s right for you, you should consult with a doctor or medical professional before taking L-Carnitine supplements.

What are the different types of carnitine supplements?

At bulk®, we sell two types of L-Carnitine supplements; 1000mg capsules, and pure L-Carnitine powder. That way, you can either take L-Carnitine capsules with a glass of water, or you can mix the powder into your preferred formula, or even use it as part of a homemade, DIY pre-workout formula. You can also find L-Carnitine in a number of pre-workout formulas.

How do they work?

L-Carnitine is a branched, nonessential amino acid, so it works in a similar way to other amino acids, contributing to a range of bodily functions. Carnitine comes in two forms, but L-Carnitine is the form that is used by the body, and can be found naturally in a number of everyday foods, such as meat and dairy products.

Is it OK to take carnitine supplements every day?

L-Carnitine is a nonessential amino acid that is produced naturally by your own body, so it’s perfectly fine to take Carnitine supplements every day if you require them as part of your dietary intake. Like all nutritional supplements, you should only consume L-Carnitine supplements as instructed, and if you aren’t sure if they’re right for you, you should consult with your doctor or another medical professional before taking L-Carnitine supplements.
