| Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid; at times of stress, there can be a greater need for glutamine than the body can cope with. Intense training would be a prime example of a ‘time of stress.’ A lack of glutamine can result in muscle breakdown and/or compromised immune function. Different forms of glutamine are more suitable for different occasions,    |
| and **Bulk™** has a wide range of unbelievably priced glutamine supplements to meet your specific needs. This includes our [Glutamine Peptides Powder](https://main--bul-eds--thepixel.hlx.live/uk/products/glutamine-peptides/bpb-gpep-0000), and [Glutamine Powder](https://main--bul-eds--thepixel.hlx.live/uk/products/glutamine-powder/bpb-lglu-0000).                      |

| If you speak to many experienced weight-trainers, they would list glutamine as a ‘must have’ supplement. Here at **Bulk™**, glutamine supplements are extremely popular – when you consider the benefits and the fantastic prices we sell quality glutamine supplements for – it’s really no great surprise!                                                                     |

| What are the benefits of taking glutamine supplements? | Glutamine is an abundant amino acid, meaning it performs  |
|                                                        | similar functions in your body to other amino acids.      |
|                                                        | Glutamine supplements are generally intended for anybody  |

| Are L-glutamine supplements healthy?                   | Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in your body,   |
|                                                        | and it’s nonessential, meaning your body produces it      |
|                                                        | naturally as part of everyday bodily functions. Some      |
|                                                        | people choose to supplement their body with extra         |
|                                                        | Glutamine to ensure their body has a strong supply of     |
|                                                        | Glutamine throughout the day. For these reasons,          |
|                                                        | Glutamine is perfectly healthy as part of a balanced,     |
|                                                        | varied diet, taken as instructed.                         |
+--------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| When should you take glutamine supplements?            | Like most other amino acids, most people choose to take   |
|                                                        | Glutamine as part of a pre-workout shake formula to       |
|                                                        | provide their body with the nutrition they need for an    |
|                                                        | intense workout session. Because your body produces       |
|                                                        | Glutamine naturally throughout the day, there’s no reason |
|                                                        | you can’t take Glutamine supplements any time of day also |
|                                                        | – most people choose to take them with meals, or before   |
|                                                        | workouts.                                                 |

| Who should take glutamine supplements?                 | Glutamine powders and supplements are intended for anyone |

|                                                        | additional Glutamine. Because it’s produced naturally by  |
|                                                        | your body, it’s a perfectly healthy supplement to take as |
|                                                        | part of a healthy diet with regular exercise – but if     |
|                                                        | you’re not sure if it’s right for you, you should consult |
|                                                        | with a doctor or medical professional before taking       |

| How do glutamine supplements work?                     | Glutamine is an abundant, nonessential amino acid, so it  |
|                                                        | works in a similar way to other amino acids, contributing |
|                                                        | to a range of bodily functions. Glutamine is the most     |

|                                                        | more bodily functions and processes than any other amino  |
