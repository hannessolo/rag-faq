| EAA stands for essential amino acids. EAA are amino acids that cannot be synthesised by the body and need to be consumed in the diet. EAA supplements have a number of performance and health benefits. **Bulk™** only supply the most researched and sought after EAA supplements, including an optimally dosed EAA formula containing the full spectrum of EAAs. |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| As EAAs can’t be synthesised by the body, so it is essential that there is an ample supply of EAAS in the diet. Smaller quantities of EAA supplements have been shown to increase protein synthesis, when                                                                                                                                                          |
| compared to higher quantities of ‘whole’ protein. EAA supplements can be used to ‘top up’ the EAA content of other meals, on their own as an intra-workout drink or taken regularly throughout the day.                                                                                                                                                            |

|                                                      | especially good if you’re on an intense weightlifting or  |

| What are the different types of amino acids?         | The 3 main types of amino acid are Essential,             |

|                                                      | (EAAs) can only be obtained through your diet—your body   |
|                                                      | can’t synthesise them on its own—making them vital in any |
|                                                      | diet. Nonessential Amino Acids can be synthesized by the  |
|                                                      | body from other nutrients. Conditional Amino Acids are    |
|                                                      | amino acids that your body doesn’t generally need, but    |
|                                                      | may require during certain times, such as during illness  |
|                                                      | or intense stress. There are also Branched Chain Amino    |
|                                                      | Acids (BCAAs) which are particularly important for        |

| How do essential amino acids work?                   | Amino Acids are the building blocks of protein and muscle |
|                                                      | tissue in your body. When you consume any kind of protein |
|                                                      | in your diet, your body breaks it down into various amino |
|                                                      | acids, which it then uses to repair and grow muscle, as   |
|                                                      | well as for a range of other functions in the body.       |
|                                                      | Essential Amino Acids are a group of amino acids that     |
|                                                      | your body either cannot produce on its own, or cannot     |
|                                                      | produce fast enough for your body’s needs, meaning you    |
|                                                      | have to obtain them from food or supplements.             |
+------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Is it OK to take essential amino acids every day?    | Your body uses Essential Amino Acids every single second  |
|                                                      | of every single day, so naturally it’s okay to take       |

|                                                      | eat a healthy, varied diet, you probably do already. Like |
|                                                      | any food or nutritional supplement, you should always     |
|                                                      | consume Essential Amino Acids according to the            |
|                                                      | recommended intake or dosage.                             |
