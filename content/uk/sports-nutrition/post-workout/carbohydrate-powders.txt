To speed up the recovery process, rapidly replenishing muscle glycogen (fuel) levels should be a priority – the carbohydrate powders in this category have been selected as they do just that! What’s more, these carbohydrate powders also create an all-important insulin spike post workout, which helps to drive nutrients into the muscles at rapid speed – facilitating almost instant growth and repair. Aim to use around 1 gram of carbohydrate powder per kilogram of body weight after a training session. This should be accompanied with approximately 1/2 as much protein, in order to start the process of refuelling the body. The addition of an amino acid powder and/or a growth and recovery supplement is also recommended.
