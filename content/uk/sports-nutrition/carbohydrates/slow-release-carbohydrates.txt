| For sustained release of energy, slow release carbohydrates are the ideal choice. Slow release carbohydrates take the body longer to break down and convert into energy, hence why they are also often referred to as complex carbohydrates. The result is   |
| that energy is given to the body over an extended period, with only a small impact on blood sugar levels. Controlling blood sugar levels helps to stabilise insulin levels which, in turn, can reduce fat storage.                                           |
|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Slow release carbohydrates are good to have for breakfast, mid-morning/afternoon snacks, lunch and dinner. They are viewed as the healthy alternative to fast release carbohydrates, but both do have their place in supplementation.                        |
