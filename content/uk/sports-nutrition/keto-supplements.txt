| The keto diet, or ketogenic, diet, is still massively popular amongst the fitness community and non-athletes alike.   |
| This might be partly because studies suggest that it could lead to an increase in fat burning during exercise. This   |
| high-fat, high-protein and low carb diet works by encouraging the body to switch fuel sources.                        |
|                                                                                                                       |
| When exercising at a high intensity, the body normally gets most of its energy from burning carbohydrates - but on    |
| the ketogenic diet, fat oxidation is significantly upregulated, which produces ketones. This process of breaking down |
| body fat for energy is known as ketosis, or keto for short.                                                           |
|                                                                                                                       |
| It can be tricky transitioning from burning carbohydrates to burning fat on a keto diet, as your body naturally       |
| prefers carbohydrates as its main source of energy when you exercise. The diet involves eating a very low amount of   |
| carbohydrates (typically below 50g per day) and prioritising fat and protein instead. As a result, you might need to  |
| use keto supplements to make sure your body is still getting all the nutrients it needs, as well as to increase your  |
| intake of fats and MCTs.                                                                                              |
|                                                                                                                       |
| We sell a variety of keto supplements to help anyone planning on starting a ketogenic diet or people who are already  |
| on one. Our team of nutritionists have put together a range of ketogenic supplements to cater to every need. From MCT |
| oils and powders and low-calorie syrups to amino acid supplements, vitamins and high protein snacks, we’ve got        |
| something for you. For instance, MCT Oil is popular in the keto community as it provides a convenient, easily         |
| digestible source of fat. L-Carnitine is involved with carrying fat to the mitochondria for energy production; as a   |
| result, L-Carnitine pills and powders are popular amongst the keto community. Or if you’re looking to satisfy your    |
| sweet tooth while watching your carb intake, try out our selection of zero-calorie syrups. We’ve got a range of       |
| keto-friendly products to try.                                                                                        |
|                                                                                                                       |
| Check out our selection of pills, powders, shakes and snacks designed to support a keto diet.                         |

| Which keto supplement is best?          | We sell a range of keto supplements that all offer        |
|                                         | support in different ways, so the best supplement largely |
|                                         | depends on your goals and intended use. We have a         |
|                                         | selection of keto-friendly supplements such as Keto       |
|                                         | Shakes and Keto Coffee, and a selection of supplements    |
|                                         | that would support the keto diet such as MCT Oil,         |
|                                         | L-Carnitine, and high protein snacks.                     |

| Does the keto diet help me lose weight? | To put it simply, taking in less energy than you burn     |
|                                         | will lead to weight loss. If the keto diet is resulting   |
|                                         | in an energy deficit over a prolonged period, then weight |
|                                         | loss will likely occur. The keto diet is a low            |
|                                         | carbohydrate, high protein diet where the goal is to      |
|                                         | switch the body's primary energy source to fat rather     |
|                                         | than carbohydrates (glucose), but this does not always    |
|                                         | equate to weight loss unless an energy deficit is         |
|                                         | established.                                              |
+-----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Are keto supplements harmful?           | There may be harmful supplements out there, though the    |
|                                         | keto supplements we sell are mostly MCT oils, foods, and  |
|                                         | amino acids that all help support the keto diet in one    |
|                                         | way or another. These are not known to pose any health    |
|                                         | risks.                                                    |
