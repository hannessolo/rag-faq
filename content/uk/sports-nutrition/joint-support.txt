| Anyone that has trained consistently hard for an extended period is likely to be familiar with injuries, as well as   |
| the aches and pains that unfortunately seem to become a part of everyday life. Joint supplements are often used as a  |
| treatment for such joint injuries. Ideally, joint health supplements should be used for prevention, as once you’re    |
| injured a weakness has been created (as well as resulting in missed training sessions) that may be difficult to fully |
| treat.                                                                                                                |
|                                                                                                                       |
| For strength athletes, the whole body is being forced to deal with abnormally high loads. While this is a necessary   |
| part of strength training, it puts a huge stress not just on the muscles, but the whole musculoskeletal system – this |
| includes our joints.                                                                                                  |
|                                                                                                                       |
| Joint supplements are designed to provide joint support, improve joint health, reduce joint pain and inflammation,    |
| maintain healthy joint function and prevent injury from occurring in the first place.                                 |
