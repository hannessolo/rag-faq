| While breakfast is typically considered the most important meal of the day, the post workout window is the most       |
| important feeding occasion for anyone that has exercised. What you put into your body after a workout, will determine |
| what you get out of the session. Basically, don’t waste your time by training really hard only to then neglect your   |
| post workout nutrition!                                                                                               |
|                                                                                                                       |
| An ideal post workout combination consists of protein, carbohydrates and amino acids. Make your own post-workout      |
| drink by combining these ingredients, or consume something that is ready to go – such as Complete All in One™.        |
|                                                                                                                       |
| For those trying to increase muscle, training has resulted in a breakdown of muscle fibers and the burning of fuel    |
| (glycogen). The advantage of a post workout shake is that it gives the muscles an immediate supply of important       |
| nutrients, as soon as you’ve finished training. The alternative is showering, driving home, cooking and depriving     |
| your muscles of growth and repair nutrients for an extended period.                                                   |
|                                                                                                                       |

|                                                     | recover. When we workout, we use up a lot of fuel that    |

| What are the benefits of post-workout supplements?  | The benefits of post-workout supplements come from what   |
|                                                     | they give your body after you’ve trained. A mix of        |

|                                                     | them most - after they’ve been worked.                    |

| When should I take a post-workout?                  | Post-workouts are most effective when taken within 2      |
|                                                     | hours after your workout.                                 |

| Who should take post-workout supplements?           | Post-workout supplements are for anyone. When we train,   |
|                                                     | we put our body under stress - good stress, but it’s      |
|                                                     | still stress. When our training session is over, it’s     |
|                                                     | important we treat our bodies well and give them what we  |

| What is the shelf life of post-workout supplements? | Our post-workout powders have a long shelf life, and can  |
|                                                     | be kept at room temperature. As with any supplement, it’s |
|                                                     | important to keep an eye on the expiry date printed on    |
|                                                     | the pouch, and to adhere to this, along with any storage  |
|                                                     | instructions. For some of our other supplements, such as  |
|                                                     | our Macro-Munch protein bars, they may have a slightly    |
|                                                     | shorter shelf life - but we doubt they’ll be hanging      |
|                                                     | around in your cupboard too long anyway!                  |

| What can a post-workout supplement help with?       | Post-workout supplements are generally high-protein       |
|                                                     | powders that contain other ingredients that help support  |
|                                                     | muscle recovery, protein synthesis, physical performance, |
|                                                     | and general post workout recovery. Post-workout           |
|                                                     | supplements aren't like your usual protein powders, they  |
|                                                     | have additional ingredients such as essential amino       |
|                                                     | acids, creatine and other ergogenic aids, carbohydrates,  |
|                                                     | and essential vitamins and minerals that can help boost   |
|                                                     | recovery, particularly after high-intensity training.     |
