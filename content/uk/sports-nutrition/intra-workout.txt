| Intra workout supplements are designed to be consumed during a workout and play an important role in nutrition for    |
| performance and physique development. Gym enthusiasts are starting to realise that neglecting intra workout           |
| supplements means they are essentially missing a trick. **Bulk™** has a select range of intra workout supplements to  |
| help you not only get the most from your workout, but also to protect your muscles against muscle breakdown.          |
|                                                                                                                       |
| We would also strongly recommend combining one or more intra workout supplements with both pre and post workout       |
| supplements, providing optimum nutrition around the times when your body needs it most!                               |
|                                                                                                                       |
| For many, carbohydrate drinks, such as vitargo, have always been the choice for during a workout. It has been a       |
| fairly recent development though whereby research has focused on the benefits of consuming additional nutrients,      |
| branched chain amino acids for example, to supply energy and to protect the muscles during intense training sessions. |
| This is particularly relevant if sessions are of a long duration or are of a particularly intense nature; for example |
| if during weight training you are performing lots of supersets and/or dropsets.                                       |
|                                                                                                                       |

| How many carbs should you take during your workout?   | Your carb intake depends on your goals. If you want to    |
|                                                       | bulk up and put on weight, then you should make sure      |
|                                                       | you’re implementing supplements that have high protein,   |
|                                                       | and more carb content than other supplements, so you can  |
|                                                       | reach your calorie goals in a healthy way. If you feel as |

|                                                       | fast-release carbs are a good quick fix, but be aware     |
|                                                       | that their sugar content can cause a spike in insulin,    |
|                                                       | and it’s important to balance this out. Slow-release      |

| Is it OK to workout on an empty stomach?              | Various schools of thought exist on this matter. Some     |

|                                                       | while toning up. Of course, no food means no fuel - you   |

|                                                       | sugar. It’s ultimately up to you to discover what suits   |
