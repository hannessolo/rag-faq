|                                                    | store in your muscles to the point of saturation. This    |
|                                                    | process can take up to 4 weeks, depending on whether a    |
|                                                    | loading phase is implemented or not. However, you may     |

|                                                    | powerlifters but also endurance and team sports athletes. |
|                                                    | In terms of dietary requirements, creatine truly is for   |
|                                                    | anyone. Omnivores, pescatarians, vegetarians and vegans;  |
|                                                    | you’re all welcome!                                       |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| How does creatine work?                            | Creatine is a naturally occurring substance found in      |
|                                                    | muscle cells. It helps our muscles produce energy during  |
|                                                    | heavy lifting or intense, short bursts of exercise. When  |
|                                                    | you supplement with creatine, you are essentially         |
|                                                    | increasing your stores of phosphocreatine (stored energy  |
|                                                    | in muscle cells), thus helping your body produce more ATP |
|                                                    | (adenosine triphosphate, a high energy molecule referred  |
|                                                    | to as our body's energy currency). In short, more ATP     |
|                                                    | equals more energy and better physical performance.       |
+----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Does creatine make you gain weight?                | Firstly, it's important to understand that weight gain    |
|                                                    | and fat gain are two different things. In this case,      |
|                                                    | taking creatine does not lead to fat gain, though it can  |
|                                                    | lead to an increase in weight. Creatine draws water into  |
|                                                    | muscle cells, which gives a fuller and more bloated       |
|                                                    | appearance, and often a slight increase on the scales.    |
|                                                    | Water retention caused by creatine is not permanent and   |
|                                                    | can be alleviated by drinking plenty of water throughout  |
|                                                    | supplementation.                                          |
