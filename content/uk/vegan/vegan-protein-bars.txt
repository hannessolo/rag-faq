As such, vegan and flexitarian consumers alike are often looking for easy ways to increase their protein intake. It’s for this reason that vegan protein bars have become such a popular product with the Bulk™ community. And it’s helped of course by the fact that our selection of vegan bars and snacks leads the way in terms of taste and satisfaction. With an average customer review score of https://dev--bul-eds--thepixel.hlx.live/4.5/5 across our vegan snacking range, which encompasses best sellers such as our world-famous Vegan Protein Brownie and our world-first Vegan Protein Blondie, it’s no wonder that Bulk™ has become the place to go for anyone looking to increase their protein intake from animal and dairy free sources.
