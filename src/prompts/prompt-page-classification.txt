You are given the content of a web page.

You must classify the type of content that is on the page. A page can have multiple categories, eg. if it has an FAQ section and also offers a product for sale, it would be ["product_details_page", "faq_page"]

The available page types are:

- blog_article: An article in a blog
- product_details_page: A page offering a product for sale. It must be a single, concrete product offered for purchase. The page must contain a price for the product AND an action to buy or add to cart. Simply having a link to a product is not enough.
- product_listing_page: A page listing a category or overview of products to buy
- faq_page: A page containing FAQs
- content_page: Any page that does not fit one of the above is labeled a content_page

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a JSON array of objects. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting.

Now classify the following page:

======= START INPUT ========

{context}

======= END INPUT ==========

Respond with ONLY a JSON array of objects. Each object should be formatted as follows:

{
  "page_types": string[],
  "reasoning": string
}
