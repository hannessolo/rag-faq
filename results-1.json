    "question": "¿Qué ventajas y desventajas tiene tomar creatina?",
    "answer": "Las ventajas de tomar creatina incluyen el aumento del rendimiento físico durante ejercicios de alta intensidad y en ráfagas sucesivas, así como el aumento de la masa muscular y la fuerza [1][3]. Sin embargo, una desventaja podría ser que la creatina puede llevar a una retención de agua en los músculos, lo que produce una apariencia más llena y un ligero aumento de peso, aunque esto no es permanente y puede manejarse bebiendo suficiente agua [4].",
